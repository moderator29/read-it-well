# Vallo documentation

This index lists the live documentation, grouped by what you are trying to do. When a document disagrees with the code or the database, the code and the database are right, and the document should be fixed in the same change that finds the error.

Read [`../HANDOFF.md`](../HANDOFF.md) first: it is the only handoff and carries the product rules, the company facts and how work is done. For setup, architecture and the repository layout, see the [repository README](../README.md).

Retired material (old session handoffs, dated sweeps and audits, research notes and the founder's prompt corpus) was deleted on 17 October 2026 and is not to be recreated. Anything in git history before that date is history, not guidance. Do not add plans, ledgers, dated reports or status files to `docs/`: that record belongs in commit messages.

## Understand the product

| Document | What it is for |
|---|---|
| [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) | What Vallo is, who it serves, what a listing is, who can do what, and the vocabulary. Read it first |

| [RULINGS.md](RULINGS.md) | The founder's rulings D51 to D85 that are still in force, one line each, and which ones were retired. Code comments cite them by number |

## Marketing

[marketing/](marketing/) holds the launch campaign, the device showcase, the two videos and their source screenshots, with [marketing/DELIVERY-2026-10.md](marketing/DELIVERY-2026-10.md) as the record of what was delivered.

## The founder in his own words

[sessions/founder-corpus/](sessions/founder-corpus/README.md) keeps the two founder notes the money rules still rest on: why Vallo never holds customer money, and why no provider may leak into the experience.

`design/proofs/` is ignored by git. Screenshot runs written there by the scripts in `scripts/design/` stay on the machine that made them.
