# Store privacy answers: Apple App Privacy and Google Play Data safety

Derived from the code on 24 September 2026 (branch fix/a4), not from memory.
Each answer names the code or table it comes from, so the next change to what
is collected changes this file in the same commit. The privacy notice
(`apps/web/src/lib/legal/privacy.tsx`, version 2026-09-24) says the same
things in prose. **If this file and the notice ever disagree, the store forms
are wrong. Stop and reconcile before submitting.** A mismatch on Play's Data
safety form is grounds for suspension.

Facts that apply to every row:

- **Tracking: NO, for every data type.** There is no advertising SDK, no IDFA
  or Android advertising ID, no third-party analytics, and no data is shared
  with data brokers (`grep -rn -i "firebase-analytics\|mixpanel\|segment\.io\|gtag(\|fbq(\|googletagmanager\|posthog\|@vercel/analytics" apps/web/src apps/web/package.json` finds no SDK, only unrelated prose). So on iOS there is no App
  Tracking Transparency prompt and no `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`.
- **Encrypted in transit: YES.** HTTPS only, HSTS with preload (`next.config.ts`
  headers), `cleartext: false` in the shell.
- **Deletion: YES.** In the app: Settings → Account → Delete my account. On the
  web, with no install and no sign-in needed: `https://www.vallospaces.com/delete-account`.
  Some data is kept after deletion for legal reasons, and Play's form allows
  for that:
  - Transaction records are kept for five years with the name and contact
    details removed.
  - An approved agent's identification is kept for five years under the AML
    rules.

  The notice (§7) and `/delete-account` say both.
- **Processors are service providers, not "sharing".** Supabase, Vercel,
  Paystack, Resend, Anthropic, MapTiler/CARTO, FCM/APNs and Sentry process
  data on our instructions. Under Play's definitions that is not sharing.
  Showing your booking details to the lister you booked with is a transfer the
  user starts, which Play also exempts. **So "Shared" is NO for every type.**

## Part A: Apple App Store Connect → App Privacy

### Q1. "Do you or your third-party partners collect data from this app?"
**Yes, we collect data from this app.**

### Q2. The data types we collect, with the three follow-up questions for each

For each type Apple asks: (a) how it is used, (b) is it linked to the user's
identity, (c) is it used for tracking. **(c) is No for every row.**

| Apple category → type | Collected? | (a) Purposes to tick | (b) Linked to the user? | Where in the code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Contact Info → **Name** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | `profiles.first_name/surname/display_name`, `agent_applications.full_name` |
| Contact Info → **Email Address** | Yes | App Functionality, Customer Support | Yes | `auth.users.email`, `support_tickets.email` |
| Contact Info → **Phone Number** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | `profiles.phone` (optional), `agent_applications.phone` |
| Contact Info → **Physical Address** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | `agent_applications.residential_address` (agents), the address of a listed property |
| Contact Info → Other User Contact Info | No | | | |
| Health & Fitness (both) | No | | | |
| Financial Info → **Payment Info** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | `payment_methods` keeps Paystack's card token, card type, last four digits and expiry. The full card number never reaches us. |
| Financial Info → Credit Info | No | | | |
| Financial Info → **Other Financial Info** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | `payout_accounts` (the bank account a lister's share and Guarantee payouts go to), `transactions` with each payment's split, `deal_agreements`, `guarantee_claims`. No wallet or balance is kept (Track A, 25 September 2026). |
| Location → **Precise Location** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | Listing and stay pin from "use my location"; `price_check_watches.lat/lng` (3 decimals, about 110 m, which Apple counts as precise). Only when the person taps; never in the background. |
| Location → Coarse Location | No | | | State and local government are typed or picked by the person, not derived from the device. That is User Content, not Location. |
| Sensitive Info | No | | | Nothing about race, religion, health, sexuality, politics, biometrics or genetics is collected. |
| Contacts | No | | | No address-book access (no `NSContactsUsageDescription`). |
| User Content → **Emails or Text Messages** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | In-app messages between members (`messages`). |
| User Content → **Photos or Videos** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | Listing photos and walkthrough videos, avatars and covers, photos sent in a thread, post and story media. |
| User Content → Audio Data | No | | | The only sound is in a walkthrough video, which is already declared under Photos or Videos. Nothing records audio on its own. |
| User Content → Gameplay Content | No | | | |
| User Content → **Customer Support** | Yes | Customer Support | Yes | `support_tickets`, the support chat |
| User Content → **Other User Content** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | posts, comments, stories, reviews, listings' descriptions, questions typed to the AI assistant (`ai_conversations`), bio |
| Browsing History | No | | | |
| Search History | **Yes** | App Functionality | Yes | `saved_searches`, `price_check_events` (area and property searched) |
| Identifiers → **User ID** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | the account id |
| Identifiers → **Device ID** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | `push_tokens` (APNs or FCM token, if notifications are on); `known_devices.fingerprint` (a code derived from the device, used for new-sign-in warnings) |
| Purchases → **Purchase History** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | bookings, reservations, payments |
| Usage Data → **Product Interaction** | **Yes** | Analytics | Yes | `price_check_events.stage` records how far a person got in the price check. This is the only usage record. Declare it; do not answer "no usage data". |
| Usage Data → Advertising Data | No | | | |
| Usage Data → Other Usage Data | No | | | |
| Diagnostics → **Crash Data** | Yes (only when `SENTRY_DSN` is set) | App Functionality | **No** | `lib/observability/report.ts` scrubs identifiers before sending. If Sentry is not configured at submission time, answer No, and change it the day it is switched on. |
| Diagnostics → **Performance Data** | **Yes** | App Functionality | **No** | `web_vitals_samples`: page speed figures (route template, metric, connection type), no user id, kept 30 days. Collected in the app too. Corrected 30 September 2026 (C15); the iOS privacy manifest says the same. |
| Diagnostics → Other Diagnostic Data | No | | | |
| Surroundings, Body | No | | | |
| Other Data → **Other Data Types** | Yes | App Functionality | Yes | Government ID and NIN, business registration documents (agents and hosts); occupation and interests (optional, on the profile) |

### Q3. "Does your app use data for tracking?"
**No.**

### The privacy policy URL
`https://www.vallospaces.com/privacy`

### Things to know on submission day
- **Third-party AI (guideline 5.1.2(i)).** Say in the review notes: "The in-app
  assistant and support chat use Anthropic. The app discloses this and asks
  for agreement before the first message. Without agreement nothing is sent,
  and the server refuses. Support by a person, with no AI, is at /contact."
- **Sign-in.** Email and password only (Google is off, and Sign in with Apple
  turns on only when configured), so guideline 4.8 does not apply.

## When to change this file
Change this file in the same commit as any of the following:
- a new table or column holding personal data;
- a new third-party host in `apps/web/src`;
- a new permission in `Info.plist` or `AndroidManifest.xml`;
- Sentry being switched on or off.

`apps/web/src/lib/legal/privacy-truth.test.ts` fails if the code starts
calling a processor the notice does not name. It does not read this file:
reconciling this file is the job of the person who makes the change.
