-- DRAFT, not applied. THE RESTAURANT FEES DESK READS THE SAME LAGOS MONTHS FOR BILLS AS FOR SEATED TABLES.
--
-- What it fixes: `public.restaurant_seated_fees(p_months)` limits the seated
-- tables to the last p_months Lagos months but read paid bills from all time,
-- so once bills are paid through Vallo the desk would grow a row for every
-- month that ever had a paid bill, outside the window it says it shows.
-- Also a Lagos-time slip in both windows: `date_trunc('month', now() at time
-- zone 'Africa/Lagos')` is a local timestamp without a zone, and comparing it
-- with a timestamptz casts it in the session zone (UTC), so the window opened
-- at 01:00 Lagos on the first of the month and a table seated in that first
-- hour fell out of the oldest month. Both windows now convert the local start
-- back to a Lagos instant with `at time zone 'Africa/Lagos'`.
--
-- BEFORE APPLYING: read the live definition
--   select pg_get_functiondef('public.restaurant_seated_fees(integer)'::regprocedure);
-- and check it matches 20261013071048_restaurant_fee_per_seated_table.sql (the
-- per seated TABLE version). Check the grants after.
