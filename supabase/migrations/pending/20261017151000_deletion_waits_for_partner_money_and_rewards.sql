-- DRAFT, NOT APPLIED. Check against the live definition before applying:
--   select pg_get_functiondef('public.account_deletion_blockers(uuid)'::regprocedure);
-- It must still match 20260924020602_the_purge_erases_what_it_promises_and_never_money.sql
-- apart from the lines marked NEW below; if it has drifted, re-base this on the
-- live body rather than applying it as written. Also confirm the live columns:
--   provider_arrangements (buyer_user_id, seller_user_id, amount_minor, status) and
--   its status check, rewards_ledger (member_id, amount_minor), rewards_payouts
--   (member_id, status) and its status check, and private.referral_policy_now()
--   returning payouts_enabled and withdrawal_min_minor.

-- WHAT IT FIXES. A deletion could start while a licensed partner held or was
-- moving money for this person, and while Vallo still owed them a rewards
-- balance or was sending one to their bank. account_deletion_blockers counted
-- rent refunds, bookings, tables, listings and businesses, and nothing of
-- either. It now answers three more numbers, and 'blocked' includes them, so
-- schedule_account_deletion (which refuses when 'blocked' is true) refuses too:
--
--   partner_held_minor          kobo in provider_arrangements where this person is
--                               the buyer or the seller and the money is held or
--                               in motion at the partner: 'payment_processing',
--                               'protected', 'release_requested', 'disputed', and
--                               'unknown' (the partner's answer was lost, so money
--                               may have moved; staff read it back).
--   rewards_withdrawable_minor  the Rewards Balance (sum of rewards_ledger) when it
--                               can actually be withdrawn: positive, at or over the
--                               policy's withdrawal minimum, and payouts on. A
--                               balance that cannot be withdrawn does not block,
--                               because a blocker with no way out is a dead end
--                               (the rule apps/web/src/lib/account-deletion/
--                               preconditions.ts is built on); the deletion screen
--                               does not hold a data-protection right hostage to a
--                               balance the person cannot move.
--   rewards_payouts_in_flight   rewards payouts 'under_review', 'processing', 'sent'
--                               or 'unknown' (the set my_rewards_summary counts as
--                               sent): money on its way to their bank.
