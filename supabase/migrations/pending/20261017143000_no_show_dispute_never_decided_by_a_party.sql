-- DRAFT, NOT APPLIED. Check against the live definition before applying:
--   select pg_get_functiondef('public.resolve_inspection_no_show(uuid, boolean)'::regprocedure);
-- It must still match 20261013063125_viewing_no_show_c_functions.sql apart
-- from the lines marked NEW below; if it has drifted, re-base this on the live
-- body rather than applying it as written.
--
-- WHAT IT FIXES. `resolve_inspection_no_show` checks that the caller is an
-- admin, but not WHO the caller is, so an admin who reported the no-show, or
-- who was said to have stayed away, or who is either side of the viewing,
-- could decide their own dispute. Every other admin desk refuses self-review.
-- The app now refuses it too (`resolveNoShow` in
-- apps/web/src/lib/inspections/no-show-actions.ts, which also covers a scoped
-- staff member calling through the service role, where auth.uid() is null);
-- this is the half an attacker cannot skip for a signed-in admin.
--
-- The function body is otherwise unchanged. Probe:
-- supabase/tests/probes-pending/no-show-dispute-self-review.sql (move it to probes/ once applied).
