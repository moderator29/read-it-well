-- VIEWING-REMINDER-WHEN (pending migration 20261017150000_viewing_reminder_day_from_dates):
--  1. a 'soon' reminder at 22:30 Lagos for a 00:30 visit says tomorrow, not today
--  2. a reminder on the visit's own Lagos day says today
--  3. the 'eve' case (19:00 the evening before) still says tomorrow with the date
-- Reads only; the final raise rolls back nothing because nothing is written.
