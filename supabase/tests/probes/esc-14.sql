-- ESC-14: a stay the host accepted but the guest never paid lapses 24 hours
-- after acceptance, or on check-in day once the acceptance is two hours old,
-- and its nights go back. Controls left alone: a paid CONFIRMED stay, an
-- accepted stay still inside its 24 hours with a future check-in, a stay
-- accepted within the last two hours on check-in day, a payment in flight
-- (on check-in day too, up to 26 hours after acceptance), and a rent charge.
-- Rolls back.
-- 29 September 2026: payment now opens only on an approved agreement
-- (docs/MONEY_ARCHITECTURE.md), and the sweep's clock follows it: a stay whose
-- agreement is approved lapses 24 hours after APPROVAL, or on check-in day
-- once the approval is two hours old; one whose agreement still waits on the
-- parties or review is kept for 72 hours after acceptance unless check-in day
-- has come; a stay with no agreement (accepted before Track A) keeps the
-- acceptance clock. The fixtures now accept each stay the way the app does
-- (PENDING to CONFIRMED, so the trigger draws the agreement), approve it
-- where the case needs it, and open every charge through the payment gate
-- (approved agreement, same amount, the split); the paid stay's charge opens
-- PENDING and then succeeds. "In flight" is private.payment_attempt_in_flight
-- (opened in the last 45 minutes). Every original assertion is kept, with the
-- approval taking the place of the acceptance as the clock; the 26-hour cap
-- on a checkout is kept too (26 hours after approval). Added: a pre-Track-A
-- stay with no agreement still lapses on the acceptance clock, an agreement
-- awaiting the parties inside 72 hours is kept, and one past 72 hours lapses.
