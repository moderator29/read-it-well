-- SEC-09: a member writing straight through PostgREST meets the same kind of
-- limit the server actions apply: the 61st message in ten minutes and the
-- 31st report in an hour are refused (54000); up to the limit every insert
-- lands; the service role is not counted.
--
-- 29 September 2026: the member's real activity counts toward the same
-- windows (public.rate_limits, fixed windows, committed by other writers), so
-- three real messages sent a minute before a run made the "sixty land"
-- control fail. The probe now reads what the member has already used in the
-- current windows (short and daily) and fills exactly the room left, then
-- proves the next insert is refused. now() is fixed for the transaction, so
-- the window cannot turn over mid-probe.
