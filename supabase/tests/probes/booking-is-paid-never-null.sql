-- BOOKING-IS-PAID-NEVER-NULL: private.booking_is_paid answers true or false,
-- never NULL. pov05 made it `exists(...) or <partner position> in (...)`, which
-- is NULL for a booking with no payment and no partner arrangement, and every
-- guard written as `not private.booking_is_paid(...)` then let an unpaid stay
-- through (my_stay_details revealed the address and gate code; check-in took an
-- unpaid stay). Fixed by pending/pd01_booking_is_paid_never_null.sql.
-- Read-only: a booking id that does not exist has no payment and no arrangement.
