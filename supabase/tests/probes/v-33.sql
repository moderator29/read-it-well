-- V-33: rent never rests at Vallo. A paid rent charge settles the lister's
-- share to the lister in the same charge, for the gross less the Guarantee
-- contribution and the processor's cut, once per booking; a support refund
-- records as owed back by the lister at most what the lister received, the
-- fee being the platform's cost. Everything runs on an example listing made
-- real inside the transaction, and the block always rolls back.
--
-- 29 September 2026: rewritten for Track A (docs/MONEY_ARCHITECTURE.md).
-- There is no wallet, so the lister is no longer credited a payment_in entry:
-- the charge is split by Paystack and settle_booking_charge records the
-- lister's share in ledger_entries (net_settlement_minor). Replaced: "a
-- wallet-paid charge credits the lister" and "a card charge credits gross
-- less the fee" are now one card charge opened with its split and an approved
-- agreement (the payment gate), whose ledger row gives the lister the split's
-- share less the fee; "a second ledger row credits nobody" is now "a second
-- charge on the booking settles nothing" (the rent-to-wallet trigger it
-- guarded is retired and gone); "a refund takes the credit back out of the
-- lister's wallet" is now "a refund goes to the card (booking_refunds pending)
-- and what the lister received is recorded as owed back (rent_refunds_owed)",
-- and the bound that the lister gives back at most what the lister received
-- is kept. Dropped: the lister_short path (a refund waiting until the
-- lister's wallet held it, the debt held against the spendable balance, paid
-- on retry). With no balance a refund never waits on the lister, so that
-- subject is retired custody with no equivalent. The execute check on the
-- retired trigger function private.settle_rent_charge_to_lister (gone) is
-- replaced by the same check on both settle doors.
