# Database probes

`supabase/tests/probes/*.sql` are the database's regression tests: RLS
policies, grants, triggers and SECURITY DEFINER functions, checked against the
live database as the roles that actually call them (`anon`, `authenticated`).
The unit suite (`vitest`) never reaches the database, so this folder is the only
thing that fails when a migration revokes a grant a policy needs, opens a money
table to the API roles, or lets a member publish their own listing.

## The contract (one file = one probe)

- The file is ONE `do $$ ... $$;` block. Comments above it are fine.
- It switches into an API role with `set local role authenticated` (or `anon`)
  and `perform set_config('request.jwt.claims', '{"sub":"<uuid>","role":"authenticated"}', true)`.
  The QA uids are member `957b3bd2-cce3-425d-bba9-5cd876ca3d62` and admin
  `03f3dd52-ea28-4852-9abe-e5b0a67c2a43`. Never put credentials in a probe.
- It runs a CONTROL that must succeed (so a probe that is refused everything
  cannot pass), then each refusal, catching the expected SQLSTATE.
- It ALWAYS ends in `raise exception 'PROBE_OK <file name without .sql>'`, and
  reports a failure as `raise exception 'PROBE_FAIL <id>: <what>'`. Because it
  always raises, it always rolls back.
- It reads grants with `has_table_privilege` / `has_column_privilege` /
  `has_function_privilege` or `pg_class.relacl`, never `information_schema`'s
  grant views, which answer only about the observing role.

`scripts/db-probes/contract.mjs` holds the rule; `apps/web/src/lib/db-probes/contract.test.ts`
checks every file in this folder against it on every `vitest` run, database or
not.

## Running them

### From a shell or CI

```bash
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<password>@aws-0-eu-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres' \
  node scripts/db-probes/run.mjs            # all probes
node scripts/db-probes/run.mjs --only db-20,mon-10-money-grants
node scripts/db-probes/run.mjs --check      # contract only, no database
node scripts/db-probes/run.mjs --list       # the files, one per line
```

Each probe goes to `psql` in its own transaction (`begin; <probe>; rollback;`)
with a 60 s statement timeout and a 5 s lock timeout. PASS means psql exited
non-zero and printed `PROBE_OK <id>` on an `ERROR:` line (a NOTICE never
counts); everything else, including a probe that finished without raising, is
FAIL. A probe may not call `dblink` or `pg_net`, which act outside its
transaction. Exit status: 0 all passed, 1 any failed, 2 the runner
could not run (no `DATABASE_URL`, no `psql`). Needs `psql` (`postgresql-client`).

Use the SESSION pooler (port 5432) or the direct connection, as the `postgres`
user: the probes build fixtures as the owner and `set role` into `anon` and
`authenticated` (see "Why the postgres user" below).

### In CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` job **Database probes** runs the same command when
the repository secret `PROBES_DATABASE_URL` is set. Without it the job FAILS
with a warning and a step summary saying the database was NOT checked, so it
can never pass without running. Make it a required check only after the
secret exists and the probes are green.

**Founder, one step (the secret):** Supabase dashboard, project
`uccixoonmbhrnyczyigt`, **Connect** → **Session pooler**, copy the URI with the
database password filled in. Then GitHub → the repository → Settings → Secrets
and variables → Actions → **New repository secret**: name
`PROBES_DATABASE_URL`, value that URI. It is a secret, never a variable.

**Why the `postgres` user and not a narrower role.** Several probes build
their own fixtures before switching into an API role (an escrow in a given
state, a ledger row, a draft business) and remove them again, which needs the
table owner's rights; a role that can only become `anon` or `authenticated`
fails those probes. Everything still rolls back, and the runner refuses
`dblink`/`pg_net`, the two ways to write outside the transaction. The
exposure is the secret itself: any workflow on a branch of this repository
can read it, which is acceptable only while everyone who can push already
holds production access. If that changes, move the job to `push` on `main`
only, or to a GitHub environment with required reviewers.

### In a Claude session with the Supabase MCP

There is no connection string in a session, so each file goes through
`apply_migration` (never `execute_sql`, which runs with `rolbypassrls` and can
never demonstrate a refusal):

1. `node scripts/db-probes/run.mjs --list` for the files.
2. For each, `apply_migration` with `name: probe_<id>` and the file's contents.
3. The expected answer is an ERROR whose text contains `PROBE_OK <id>`. A
   `PROBE_FAIL` or any other error is a failure.
4. Because the migration failed, nothing is recorded; confirm with
   `select version, name from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations order by version desc limit 3`.

## Adding a probe

Name it after the finding it pins, lower case (`db-01.sql`), or after what it
checks when it pins a class (`db-20.sql` is every policy's function grants).
Make it FAIL first against the defect (or a rolled-back mutation that
reintroduces it), then pass against the fix.
