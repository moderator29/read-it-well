/**
 * THE MIGRATION GATE. V-51.
 *
 * The eleven-and-a-half-hour catalogue outage of 22 to 23 September
 * (`docs/BUILD_07_LEDGER.md` section 67) was two lines of SQL a machine would
 * have caught: a revoke on a load-bearing RLS helper, and a column added to
 * `listings` without the anon column grant the catalogue read needs. The
 * ledger's own lesson was "it was in prose where it needed to be in a check".
 * This is the check. It reads migration TEXT only, needs no database and no
 * network, and runs in about a second, so it can run on every commit, in CI
 * when CI exists again, and by hand:
 *
 *     node scripts/check-migrations.mjs                 every migration
 *     node scripts/check-migrations.mjs --since 20260924000000
 *     node scripts/check-migrations.mjs --base origin/main   also refuse edits
 *
 * THE RULES, each named with the reason it exists.
 *
 *   M1 load-bearing revoke. `20260730021956_anon_execute_on_rls_helpers.sql`
 *      grants anon EXECUTE on four private helpers because permissive RLS
 *      policies are OR-ed, and a row that fails the public policy makes
 *      Postgres evaluate the next one, which calls the helper; without
 *      EXECUTE the WHOLE anonymous read raises 42501. A revoke of any of the
 *      four from anon (or of every function in `private` from anon) fails.
 *   M2 a listing column the catalogue reads, added without its anon grant.
 *      Anon holds a COLUMN list on `public.listings`, not the table, so a new
 *      column in `LISTING_SELECT` (`apps/web/src/lib/listings/
 *      supabase-repository.ts`, read here, not copied) that is not granted in
 *      the same file makes every anonymous catalogue read fail.
 *   M3 a new table in `public` without `enable row level security` in the
 *      same file. `pg_default_acl` hands every new public table to anon and
 *      authenticated; without RLS that is the whole table.
 *   M4 a SECURITY DEFINER function without a pinned `search_path`.
 *   M5 a file name that is not `<14 digits>_<snake_case>.sql`, or a timestamp
 *      two files share. Supabase orders by the prefix; a collision is an
 *      ordering nobody chose.
 *   M6 (with --base) an applied migration EDITED or DELETED. History is not
 *      rewritten; a fix is a new file.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, said so nobody leans on it for more. It reads text, so
 * SQL assembled with `format()` and `execute` is invisible to it (the
 * `track_g_7` grant is exactly that, and is why M2 also accepts a grant
 * written as `execute format(...)` naming the column). It does not apply
 * anything; the probes in `scripts/probes/` and a real Postgres are the
 * second half of V-51 and are described in the report, not faked here.
 *
 * HISTORY. Migrations already applied before this gate existed are checked
 * too, and anything they trip is listed in KNOWN below with the reason it is
 * tolerated. The list may only shrink.
