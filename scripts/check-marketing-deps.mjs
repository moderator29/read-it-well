/**
 * `scripts/marketing/` STAYS OUT OF THE PRODUCT, AND ITS LOCKFILE IS REAL.
 *
 * It landed on main carrying its own `package-lock.json` and nothing audited
 * it or said why not. This is that answer, in the lightest form that is still
 * a gate rather than a comment.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. An authoring tool, run by hand, that makes pictures of the live
 * product for other people to look at: App Store and Play screenshots, the
 * social posts and the launch video (`scripts/marketing/DESIGN.md`). Its ten
 * dependencies are a 3D emoji set, Three.js, GSAP, two icon sets, three
 * webfont packages and two map atlases. Every one of them is used to DRAW an
 * image on somebody's laptop. None of them is imported by the application, and
 * the artefacts that reach a visitor are the finished files, not the packages
 * that drew them.
 *
 * SO ITS TREE IS NOT IN THE PRODUCTION AUDIT PATH, AND THAT IS CORRECT RATHER
 * THAN AN OVERSIGHT. `scripts/marketing` is deliberately not one of the root
 * `workspaces` globs (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), so `npm ci` never installs it,
 * no CI job has it on disk, and `npm audit --omit=dev` at the root cannot see
 * it. Pulling it into the workspaces to get it audited would do the opposite of
 * making the product safer: it would put Three.js and a 3D emoji set into the
 * tree every production build resolves from, to gate code that never runs on a
 * server or in a browser a visitor opens.
 *
 * THE GATE IS THEREFORE TWO THINGS, NOT A JOB. CI runs
 * `npm audit --package-lock-only --audit-level=high --prefix scripts/marketing`
 * in the existing, non-required advisories job, which reads the committed
 * lockfile and installs nothing, so the advisories ARE checked. And this script
 * holds the thing that would make that exclusion unsafe if it ever stopped
 * being true: that the tool stays a tool. If one of its packages ever turns up
 * in the shipped dependency tree, or the application ever imports out of
 * `scripts/marketing`, the exclusion above is void and this check is the thing
 * that says so.
