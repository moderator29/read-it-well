/**
 * Generate the Vallo Supabase auth email templates.
 *
 * Supabase sends one HTML template per auth action: confirm signup, magic link,
 * recovery, email change, invite. Left at their defaults they are plain and
 * unbranded. This script emits all five from one shell plus a set of composable
 * blocks, so the lockup, the colour and the language stay identical across
 * every message and move in one place when the brand moves, rather than
 * drifting as five hand-edited files.
 *
 * Output: supabase/templates/<name>.html, and beside each one
 * supabase/templates/<name>.txt, the plain-text twin rendered from the SAME
 * block list, so the two cannot drift. Apply the HTML in the Supabase dashboard
 * under Authentication -> Email Templates, or via the Management API. The
 * dashboard takes HTML only; the .txt is the readable source of each message
 * and the text part for the day the Send Email Hook replaces SMTP (see
 * docs/email/AUTH_EMAILS.md). Today a regeneration does not reach production by itself.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/build-auth-emails.mjs
 *
 * WHY THESE FIVE MATTER MORE THAN THE OTHERS.
 *
 * They are the first email anybody ever gets from Vallo. A confirm-signup
 * message arrives before the reader has any opinion of this product at all, so
 * it is not a utility, it is the first impression. It is also the message a
 * phishing kit will imitate, which is why the copy here never asks for
 * anything, never threatens, and always says plainly what happens if the reader
 * does nothing.
 *
 * ONE DESIGN, TWO GENERATORS.
 *
 * `apps/web/src/lib/email/render.ts` builds every transactional message. This
 * script builds these five. They must look like the same product, so every
 * value below is mirrored from `apps/web/src/lib/email/theme.ts`, which is the
 * source of truth and explains why literal hex is correct in an email.
 *
 * The duplication is real and it is deliberate: this is a plain Node script
 * that runs outside the Next build with no TypeScript loader, so it cannot
 * import a `.ts` module. What makes it safe rather than merely tolerated is
 * `apps/web/src/lib/email/shell.test.ts`, which reads theme.ts, this script and
 * the generated files, and fails when a colour here is not a colour there.
 *
 * DARK, LIKE THE PRODUCT (29 September 2026, founder ruling), the same
 * document `render.ts` builds (`documentHtml`): a navy ground, one deep navy
 * card with a hairline edge carrying the lockup band, a luminous brand-blue
 * rule and the message, then the footer with the support and legal links on
 * the ground. The inline layer is dark and complete, `color-scheme: dark`
 * stops Apple Mail inverting it, and every ink keeps AA against its ground
 * written and inverted, so a client that forces its own pass still reads.
 * theme.ts says why, with the measurements.
 *
 * EMAIL CLIENT RULES OBSERVED HERE (do not undo these)
 * - Table layout only. No flex, no grid, no positioning.
 * - Every layout and colour declaration is inline on the element. The single
 *   <style> block re-asserts the dark palette for clients that restyle by
 *   scheme and nothing in it is required for the message to read correctly.
 * - System font stack only, no web fonts.
 * - background-color is always declared BEFORE background-image, because the
 *   Word rendering engine in Outlook drops background-image and keeps the
 *   colour. Every gradient therefore has a deliberate solid fallback.
 * - Container is 600px, fluid below that, and reads on a 360px Android screen.
 * - Every template keeps a plain-text fallback link, because clients strip
 *   buttons, and a hidden preheader so the inbox line is deliberate.
 * - THE MESSAGE MUST READ COMPLETELY WITH EVERY IMAGE BLOCKED. The shell
 *   carries one image, the lockup on its own navy tile, alt "Vallo". Every
 *   other word is live text.
 *
 * COPY RULES (the same ones binding on lib/email/messages.ts)
 * - No em dash characters, anywhere.
 * - No emoji.
 * - British spelling, calm and plain.
 * - No legal or financial promise. Nothing here says money is protected or
 *   guaranteed, and nothing claims a listing has been checked.
 * - Nothing advertises inventory this platform does not have.
 * - English. The product dictionary carries four locales (en, ha, ig, yo) and
 *   is English-first; Supabase renders one template per action with no locale
 *   input, so these are written once, in English, like the transactional
 *   catalogue. See docs/email/AUTH_EMAILS.md, "The language question".
