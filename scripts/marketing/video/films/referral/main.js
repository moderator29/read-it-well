/*
 * THE REFERRAL FILM, "Vallo pays you to bring people" (films/referral/timeline.json).
 *
 * One phone carries it, and the phone is on the Rewards screens the whole
 * way: the invite link, the ₦80 rule, the balance, the withdraw sheet and
 * the terms plate. Every figure on the stage is a figure the product prints
 * (supabase/migrations/20261008195310_d85_referral_signup_80_invite_and_earn.sql,
 * FACTS-OCT.md): ₦80 for each friend who SIGNS UP FULLY, up to 1,500
 * qualified referrals a month, withdraw once the Rewards Balance reaches
 * ₦1,000. The Rewards Balance is what Vallo owes you, so it is never drawn
 * as a wallet and no balance is ever invented: the only money on the stage
 * is ₦80, ₦1,000 and the screens' own ₦0.
 *
 * The clock is provisional and will be replaced by the aligner, so nothing
 * here refers to a number of seconds: every beat hangs on s(i), e(i) and
 * w(i, "word"). The voice leaves about a third of a second between lines, so
 * each chapter is cut on that breath (`cut(i)`) with a short transition.
