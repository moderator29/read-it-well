/*
 * THE LISTING FILM, "List your own place, no agency fee" (films/listing/timeline.json).
 *
 * Spoken to owners, so it is the steadiest of the three shorts: fewer, longer
 * held beats, and almost everything it holds up is a part of the live product
 * rather than something we drew. One phone carries it, the real screens of the
 * owner's own flow run on it, and the words that matter are the product's own
 * words, cropped on their components' own edges (films/blocks.py).
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS FILM MUST NEVER SAY is that a workspace goes live on
 * being described. Every workspace on Vallo is an application: the Add a
 * workspace screen says each one "gets its own tools and its own checks", and
 * the flow's last step is "Check and send". So sentence three ends on the
 * send, not on a listing appearing in search.
 *
 * Claims and figures: FACTS-OCT.md. The payments provider is never named
 * (the Agreements screen's own paragraph says "our payment processor", and
 * that paragraph is lifted whole rather than paraphrased).
 *
 * Nothing here refers to a number of seconds: the clock is provisional and
 * every beat re-anchors itself on s(i), e(i) and w(i, "word").
