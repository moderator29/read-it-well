 * THE SMALL THINGS, in English (details pass, 30 September 2026): the copy
 * confirmation, the connection line, pull to refresh, back to top, the
 * listing card's long-press menu and the retry.
 *
 * Its own module for the reason `price-check.en.ts` gives: `en.ts` is
 * written by several people in the same hour, and a namespace here costs that
 * file one import and one line. Other locales inherit these through
 * `withFallback` until a speaker writes them.
 *
 * Every line says what happened or what the reader can do. No em dashes.
