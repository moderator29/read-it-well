/**
 * Session 3's copy for the landing page and the public site (W1).
 *
 * One module per owner so nine agents can add strings without editing en.ts
 * at the same time. English only: ha, ig and yo fall back to it through
 * `withFallback` until a translator supplies a line, because an invented
 * translation of a new line is worse than none. Money sentences never live
 * here; they come from `lib/money/copy.ts` (Session 2).
 *
 * WHAT IS NEW HERE AND WHAT IS NOT. The landing reuses the words it already
 * had wherever they are honest (`landingRooms`, `publicDoors`, `trustVisible`,
 * `reel`, the brand lines under `landing`). Only the lines nothing else says
 * are written here: the name of each layer of the platform, the one sentence
 * per layer that no existing key carries, and the public menu's descriptions.
 * Every line says what the product does today and nothing it cannot show.
