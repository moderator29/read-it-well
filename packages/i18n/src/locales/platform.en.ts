/**
 * THE PLATFORM AND THE CRAFT, in English: the devices screen and the new
 * sign-in alert (V-19), the wallet hold that alert can place, and the other
 * platform surfaces built beside them.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE RATHER THAN A BLOCK INSIDE `en.ts`.
 *
 * The same reason `price-check.en.ts` gives: `en.ts` is nearly six thousand
 * lines and several workers write to it in the same hour, and a namespace in
 * its own module costs the contested file one import and one line.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CLAIMS RULE, APPLIED HERE.
 *
 * Nothing below names a place, and the omission is deliberate. The address on
 * a session is whichever of our servers refreshed its token, so "Lagos" on a
 * security alert would be a confident lie in the one place a person makes a
 * security decision (`lib/security/sessions.ts` gives the full reasoning).
 * Nor does the alert say "just now": it is read later than it is written, and
 * the screen shows the time the device was first seen instead.
 *
 * The other three locales inherit this through `withFallback`; untranslated
 * keys are a copy gap for a speaker to close, not something to paper over by
 * pasting English into `yo.ts`.
