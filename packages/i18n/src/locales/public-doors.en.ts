/**
 * THE PUBLIC DOORS, in English (Recommendations A, 30 September 2026): the
 * "Check before you pay" card on the landing, the move-in total calculator,
 * the supply pages' chrome, the guides' chrome, the sign-in-free email
 * preferences, the email-code and phone sign-in entry points, and the
 * member's invite link.
 *
 * Its own file for the reason `front-door.en.ts` gives: `en.ts` is contested,
 * and a namespace here costs it one import and one line.
 *
 * Every sentence is read by a stranger. No claim the code cannot back, no
 * invented figure, no percentage presented as typical. The other three
 * locales inherit this through `withFallback`, which is the honest state
 * until a speaker translates it (nothing here is a machine draft).
