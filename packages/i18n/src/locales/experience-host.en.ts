/**
 * THE HOST PAGES' REMAINING WORDS (C5, the route sweep, 6 October 2026).
 *
 * The host pages still spelled these in English, in `title=`, `body=` and as
 * JSX text, where no dictionary could see them. They are the pages' own words,
 * moved here unchanged.
 *
 * WHY NOT `hostWorkspace`. That namespace carries Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo
 * MACHINE DRAFTS (`locales/drafts/<locale>/`, registered in
 * `review-status.ts`), and a registered draft must stay nearly whole. A new
 * English line there would need a machine draft in three languages written
 * on the spot, and an invented translation of a new line is worse than none.
 * So, like the experience-* modules, these are English only: ha, ig and yo
 * fall back to them through `withFallback` until a translator supplies a line.
