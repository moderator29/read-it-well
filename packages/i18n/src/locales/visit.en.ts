/**
 * SCHEDULE A VISIT, in English: the two-step flow at `/listing/[id]/visit`
 * (pick a time) and `/listing/[id]/visit/[inspectionId]` (where it stands).
 *
 * Its own module for the reason `member-kit.en.ts` gives: `en.ts` is written
 * by several people in the same hour, and a namespace here costs that file one
 * import and one line. Other locales read machine drafts from
 * `drafts/<locale>/visit.ts` until a speaker reviews them.
 *
 * EVERY SENTENCE SAYS WHAT THE RECORD HOLDS. A request is "sent" until the
 * lister answers it; only a confirmed row is "confirmed"; a time the lister
 * opened is "booked" because the database confirms it in the same write.
 * Nothing here calls a person or a place safe or checked, and viewing never
 * costs money. No em dashes.
 *
 * `{name}` is the lister's public name, `{role}` their role word, `{when}` a
 * Lagos date and time already formatted for the reader's locale.
