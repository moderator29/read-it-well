/**
 * THE COUNTED NOUNS, IN A FILE OF THEIR OWN (Track M performance).
 *
 * `countOf` ("3 bedrooms") runs in the browser on cards, maps and sheets, and
 * it needs only these tables. They used to live inside each locale's whole
 * dictionary, so a card that printed one count shipped every word of every
 * language. Each locale file still carries its table as `units`, imported
 * from here, so the dictionaries have exactly the shape they had.

import type { PluralForms } from "../plural";

/**
 * DOC-22: every counted phrase the product prints, as `plural()` forms.
 *
 * These replaced about seventy hand-written `n === 1 ? "x" : "xs"` tests in
 * components, which decided the grammar of every language at once and could
 * never be translated. A phrase that carries a verb ("{count} reports have")
 * is a whole form here, because agreement differs by language as much as the
 * noun does. Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo fall back to these English forms until a
 * translator supplies them (`fallback.ts`); `Intl` picks the category, so a
 * locale with only `other` simply never asks for `one`.
 *
 * Read through `countOf(n, "noun", locale)` in `@vallo/i18n`.
