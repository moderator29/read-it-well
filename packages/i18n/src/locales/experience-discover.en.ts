/**
 * Session 3's copy for home, search, stays, restaurants, price, areas and saved (W2).
 *
 * One module per owner so nine agents can add strings without editing en.ts
 * at the same time. English only: ha, ig and yo fall back to it through
 * `withFallback` until a translator supplies a line, because an invented
 * translation of a new line is worse than none. Money sentences never live
 * here; they come from `lib/money/copy.ts` (Session 2).
 *
 * One sub-object per surface, so the agents working each surface add lines
 * inside their own block and never edit the same line twice.
