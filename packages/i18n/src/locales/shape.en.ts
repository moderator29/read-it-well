/**
 * THE PRODUCT'S OWN SHAPE, in English: the wall that names what you asked
 * for, the age of a listing, the facts of a compound, and the other small
 * words that come with deleting a second shelf.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. The same reason `price-check.en.ts` gives: `en.ts`
 * is written by several workers in the same hour, and a namespace kept in a
 * module costs that file one import and one line. Other locales inherit these
 * through `withFallback`, and declaring the English text in `yo.ts`, `ha.ts`
 * or `ig.ts` would be the coverage lie `locale-completeness.ts` refuses. An
 * untranslated key is a copy gap for a speaker to close.
 *
 * British spelling, no dashes as punctuation, and nothing here asserts
 * anything the code cannot show.
