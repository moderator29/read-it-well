/**
 * Session 3's copy for auth, the welcome tour and onboarding beyond Get Started (W11).
 *
 * One module per owner so agents can add strings without editing en.ts at
 * the same time. English only: ha, ig and yo fall back to it through
 * `withFallback` until a translator supplies a line, because an invented
 * translation of a new line is worse than none. Money sentences never live
 * here; they come from `lib/money/copy.ts` (Session 2).
