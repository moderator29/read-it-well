/**
 * Round 3's settings screens: the area navigation every settings route
 * carries (R3-08), the notification matrix (R3-14), Accessibility (R3-15) and
 * Language and currency (R3-16). These were English-only constants in
 * `apps/web/src/lib/settings/*-copy.ts` while `en.ts` was held; they live here
 * now so the screens read the reader's language.
 *
 * One module per owner so agents can add strings without editing en.ts at
 * the same time. English only: ha, ig and yo fall back to it through
 * `withFallback` until a translator supplies a line, because an invented
 * translation of a new line is worse than none.
 *
 * D48: payment notifications are still stored under the `wallet` key in
 * `profiles.settings.notifications`. That is a storage key, never a word on a
 * screen: the row here is "Payments".
