/**
 * OUTBOUND MAIL IN THE MEMBER'S OWN LANGUAGE (recommendation A11).
 *
 * The words of the account, security and booking emails, moved out of the
 * builders in `apps/web/src/lib/email/messages.ts` unchanged, so a builder
 * can be asked for Hausa, Yoruba or Igbo and still fall back to English for a
 * string a translation lacks (`withFallback`). `{name}`-style placeholders are
 * filled by the builder. The English output is byte for byte what it was.
 *
 * Every security email in another language also carries one plain English
 * line (`securityInEnglish`), so anybody helping the reader can see what it
 * is about.
