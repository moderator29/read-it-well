/**

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. The reason `price-check.en.ts` gives: `en.ts` is
 * written by several workers in the same hour, and a namespace in its own
 * module costs that file one import and one line.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CLAIMS RULE, APPLIED TO EVERY STRING BELOW. Each sentence states what
 * happened and when, never what that makes the property or the person. No
 * string here says "verified", "safe", "secure" or "guaranteed" about the
 * world; where a check is named, the sentence beside it says what the check
 * is NOT. A null never has a string, because a null renders nothing.
 *
 * Other locales inherit these through `withFallback`, which is the honest
 * state: an untranslated key is a copy gap for a speaker to close.
