/**
 * Session 3's copy for messages, the notification centre, assistant and support (W5).
 *
 * One module per owner so nine agents can add strings without editing en.ts
 * at the same time. English only: ha, ig and yo fall back to it through
 * `withFallback` until a translator supplies a line, because an invented
 * translation of a new line is worse than none. Money sentences never live
 * here; they come from `lib/money/copy.ts` (Session 2).
 *
 * Counted phrases are `{ one, other }` pairs read through `plural()`, so a
 * count is never inflected by hand. Nothing here states a figure, a name or a
 * date: those arrive from the real row and are formatted where they are drawn.
