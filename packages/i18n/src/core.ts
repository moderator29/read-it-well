/**
 * THE LIGHT HALF OF @vallo/i18n (Track M performance, 25 September 2026).
 *
 * Everything here works without a dictionary: the locale list and its
 * negotiation, the Intl tags, and the money, number, date, rating and plural
 * formatters. `index.ts` re-exports all of it and adds the four dictionaries.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE ENTRY. The package had one entry, and that entry
 * imports English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo at the top. A client component that
 * imported nothing but `formatMoney` therefore shipped every word of every
 * language to the browser: a 717 KB chunk (222 KB gzipped) that the landing
 * page, Home, Search and nearly every other route downloaded and ran before
 * they were interactive. Client code imports from `@vallo/i18n/core`; only
 * code that really needs a dictionary imports `@vallo/i18n`.
 *
 * Nothing in this file may import a locale's dictionary; the counted-noun
 * tables in `locales/units.ts` are the one exception, because `countOf`
 * needs them and they are a few kilobytes. `core-entry.test.ts` fails if a
 * dictionary comes in.

/**
 * THE TAG EVERY FORMATTER ASKS OF, AND WHY IT IS en-NG FOR EVERY LOCALE.
 *
 * Chromium carries no locale data for Yoruba, Hausa or Igbo. Asked for yo-NG
 * it quietly formats in the phone's own language instead: "Sep 25, 2026" on a
 * phone set to American English, "4 500 000 ₦" on one set to French,
 * "4.500.000 ₦" in German, Arabic-Indic digits in Arabic. Node, which renders
 * the server's HTML, carries all of CLDR and writes "25 Oṣù Owewe 2026" and
 * "₦4,500,000". So on a Yoruba, Hausa or Igbo page the server and the browser
 * wrote every price, date and short figure differently, and each one was a
 * hydration mismatch: React threw the server's HTML away and drew the page
 * again, and the reader watched the page change under them.
 *
 * en-NG is carried by every engine and writes the same thing in all of them,
 * so every locale formats with it: "₦4,500,000", "₦45k", "₦1.2b", "25 Sept
 * 2026". For numbers and money that is exactly what Node wrote for yo-NG,
 * ha-NG and ig-NG anyway. What changes is the words: month and weekday names,
 * and the letter after a short figure (Hausa wrote thousands "D" for dubu,
 * Yoruba and Igbo wrote a billion "G"), which Chrome never showed. Month names
 * in the reader's language can come back as words the locale files carry,
 * once a native speaker supplies them, rather than as whatever one engine
 * happens to ship. `portable-intl.test.ts` holds the line.
 *
 * Exported because the `<Amount>` primitive builds money from `formatToParts`
 * and must ask the same tag this file does; a second private copy would
 * drift, which is how the naira sign once ended up hard-coded in five places.
