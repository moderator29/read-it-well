/**
 * NOBODY SEES INSIDE THE PLATFORM WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT, WATCHED RATHER THAN READ.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHAT THIS PROVES AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * `src/proxy.test.ts` asserts the DECISION: that `isPublicPath` classifies
 * every route on disk the way the founder's item 8 says it should. It runs in
 * milliseconds and it cannot see whether the middleware runs at all.
 *
 * This file asserts the BEHAVIOUR. It drives a real browser at a real server
 * with the guard armed and writes down where each request landed and what it
 * answered. The two are not substitutes: a green unit test over a middleware
 * that was never invoked is the exact shape of a blind green light.
 *
 * Run it against a server started WITH Supabase configured, because the
 * middleware is a deliberate pass-through when it is not, and that is the trap
 * this spec exists to stop anybody falling into. Every other browser spec on
 * this platform runs in a sandbox that cannot reach Supabase, so every product
 * route renders signed-out there and the lock is invisible.
 *
 * The key does not have to be a real one. The middleware needs two things: the
 * public config present, so it arms itself, and `getUser()` to come back
 * without a user, which is exactly what an anonymous visitor produces.
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://example.supabase.co \
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=anything \
 *   NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-gate npx next start -p 3211
 *   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3211 node apps/web/tests/gate.spec.mjs
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE TWO TRAPS THIS REPOSITORY HAS ALREADY BEEN BITTEN BY
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Both guards are lifted from `scripts/design/proof-nav.mjs`, which paid for
 * them, rather than invented again here.
 *
 *   A 200 IS NOT A PAGE. A Next.js layout calling `notFound()` answers HTTP
 *   200 with the not-found body. `/crypto` and `/gallery` both do exactly
 *   this. So every public route is checked for the `[data-nf-not-found]`
 *   marker and for a body that rendered essentially nothing, and a route that
 *   carries either is REFUSED rather than counted as open.
 *
 *   WHERE THE BROWSER SETTLED IS READ AFTER THE REDIRECT SETTLES. Several
 *   routes on this platform redirect CLIENT side, so `page.url()` still reads
 *   the address that was asked for at the moment `load` fires and is somewhere
 *   else a second later. The public walk therefore reads the landing address
 *   after a settle, and reads the page TWICE, refusing a page whose two reads
 *   disagree instead of printing one of its two answers.
 *
 * The product walk needs neither, because a gated route never renders: it is
 * checked at the request level, where a 307 and its Location header are the
 * whole answer and a rendered body would itself be the failure.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE LISTS
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * They are written out here rather than imported from `proxy.ts` ON PURPOSE.
 * A walk that reads the rule it is testing can agree with itself while
 * disagreeing with the product. These are the product decision stated a second
 * time, by hand, and the run is what makes the two meet.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE CONTROL, WHICH IS NOT OPTIONAL
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * A GATE THAT REFUSES EVERYBODY PASSES A TEST THAT ONLY CHECKS REFUSALS.
 * Every check above is satisfied by a middleware that redirects every request
 * on the platform to `/sign-in`, which would be a catastrophe reported as a
 * clean run. So the same list is walked a second time WITH a session, and
 * every route that bounced must now not bounce.
 *
 *   GATE_SESSION_COOKIE="sb-...-auth-token=..." \
 *   BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3493 node apps/web/tests/gate.spec.mjs
 *
 * With that variable set the spec runs the control pass INSTEAD of the
 * signed-out pass, because the two need servers built against different
 * addresses. `tests/gate-stub-session.mjs` mints the cookie and explains what
 * a stand-in session can and cannot prove.
