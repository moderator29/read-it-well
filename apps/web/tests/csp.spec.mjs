/**
 * The Content Security Policy, checked against a running browser.
 *
 * A CSP is the one security control that is trivial to write and easy to get
 * wrong in a way no static reading catches, because the failure mode is not a
 * missing header. It is a header that is present, looks strict, and silently
 * forbids the application's own hydration payload, leaving a page that renders
 * server markup and then never becomes interactive. That failure looks fine in
 * a screenshot. It only shows up as a `securitypolicyviolation` event and a
 * console refusal, which is what this script collects.
 *
 * It asserts, on public routes at phone size:
 *   1. The policy is served at all, on the HTML response.
 *   2. `script-src` carries a nonce and does NOT carry 'unsafe-inline'. A
 *      policy with both is a policy with neither, since a browser that sees a
 *      nonce ignores 'unsafe-inline' but an attacker only needs one of them.
 *   3. The four directives that cost nothing and close real attacks are set:
 *      object-src, base-uri, form-action, frame-ancestors.
 *   4. The nonce is freshly minted per request, not a build-time constant. A
 *      fixed nonce is decoration: an injected script can simply carry it.
 *   5. The hand-written theme script in `app/layout.tsx` carries the nonce.
 *   6. Nothing is actually blocked. Zero violations, zero console refusals.
 *   7. The page hydrates, proving the nonce reached Next's own inline scripts.
 *   8. The policy is ENFORCING, not report-only. A report-only policy passes
 *      every other check on this list and stops nothing, which is the state
 *      this platform sat in for months. Set CSP_ENFORCE=false to run the walk
 *      against a reporting deployment on purpose.
 *
 * Self-contained: no runner, no config. Run with a server already listening:
 *
 *   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3210 node apps/web/tests/csp.spec.mjs

 * badly written policy breaks: the nonced bootstrap injects the chunk, and if
