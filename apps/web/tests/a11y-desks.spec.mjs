/**
 * C16. ACCESSIBILITY OF THE THREE DESKS: host, agent and the admin console.
 *
 * TWO SURFACES, AND THE VERDICT SAYS WHICH ONE IT MEASURED.
 *
 * 1. THE REAL HOST AND AGENT DESKS (`/host`, `/agent/dashboard`,
 *    `/agent/listings`), scanned whenever QA_MEMBER_EMAIL and
 *    QA_MEMBER_PASSWORD are set. A member session plus the passcode is the
 *    whole door, and `_gate.mjs` and `_passcode.mjs` already open both, so
 *    there was never a reason this could not be measured. A route that answers
 *    the sign-in door or stays behind the lock is a FAILURE here, never a
 *    quiet skip: a desk that was not reached was not scanned.
 * 2. THE PREVIEW HARNESS (`app/(dev)/preview/f5/*`), which draws the same
 *    components with fixtures. A production server opens it only with
 *    VALLO_PREVIEW_HARNESS=1, which CI sets on its own throwaway server and
 *    nowhere else (lib/preview-harness.ts). It remains the ONLY measurement of
 *    the admin console, because `lib/admin/guard.ts` requires a session that
 *    has proved a security key and no spec can prove one.
 *
 * Before 6 October this spec scanned the harness alone and printed
 * "a11y desks: pass", which read as a verdict on the product. The harness is a
 * fixture: it is worth measuring, and it is not the desks. Without the two QA
 * variables the real scan is now a named SKIP and the verdict says the real
 * desks went unmeasured.
 *
 * For each route at 390 and 1440, dark and light, motion off:
 *   - axe-core; SERIOUS and CRITICAL fail, moderate and minor are printed;
 *   - exactly one <h1>... is NOT asserted here: a harness page may draw two
 *     desks side by side, so landmarks are checked as "at least one main".
 * Then three scripted checks axe cannot make:
 *   - the confirm panel: focus lands inside it when it opens, Escape closes
 *     it, and focus returns to the control that opened it;
 *   - a keyboard-only walk of the desk sidebar: every link reachable by Tab,
 *     each with a visible focus ring (a non-zero outline or box-shadow);
 *   - the desks' key layer (C6): j moves focus to a row on a table desk.
 *
 *   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3210 node apps/web/tests/a11y-desks.spec.mjs
 *   A11Y_MATRIX=quick ...   dark, 390 only
