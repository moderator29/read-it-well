/**
 * Saying something without joining anything first.
 *
 * The owner tapped the plus on the feed and was told to go and join a place:
 * "in feed people can post there already when click +, currently it's saying
 * you need to join etc etc, make it that you can also already post on normal
 * public feed, without joining a places". And separately, of the tabs above the
 * feed: "make the following new and for you clean and make their button smaller
 * and rectangle shape not someone circle".
 *
 * WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG. Nothing in the database ever required a place.
 * `posts.area_id` is nullable, `posts_insert_self` allows a null area outright,
 * `posts_select` shows one to everybody including a signed-out reader, and
 * there is no membership check anywhere in the schema. The requirement lived in
 * exactly three lines of application code: one `.uuid()` on a zod field, one
 * `isMember === false` early return in the composer, and one branch in the dock
 * that turned "you are in no place" into a wall with a directory link on it.
 * Between them they made joining a room the price of speaking, on the first tap
 * of the first session.
 *
 * The database half of this is proved where it can be proved, which is against
 * the real project under the caller's own RLS rather than here. Recorded in the
 * commit: an insert with `area_id = null` as the signed-in user through
 * `private.probe_as` + `set local role authenticated` returns a LIVE row, and
 * `anon` can read it back. This file proves the application half.
