/*
 * THE OFFLINE CARD'S BEHAVIOUR (STORE-01).
 *
 * This page is what the binary shows when the live origin cannot be reached
 * (`server.errorPath` in `capacitor.config.ts`). It used to decide whether the
 * build had a server by calling `window.Capacitor.getConfig()`, which does not
 * exist in Capacitor 8, so every shipping build showed a developer card, and
 * its button reloaded this packaged page instead of retrying the origin.
 *
 * Now the origin is WRITTEN INTO THE BUILD (`shell-config.js`, from
 * `scripts/write-shell-config.mjs`) and read from there. The one
 * `window.Capacitor` member used is `nativePromise`, to hide the splash; see
 * `hideSplash` below. Retrying checks the origin answers, then
 * replaces this page with the app's start path; the `online` event does the
 * same by itself when the connection returns.
 *
 * KEEPS TRYING BY ITSELF (8 October 2026). The `online` event is not enough
 * on its own: a phone that never lost its Wi-Fi association but had no
 * internet behind it never fires it. So after a failed probe the card tries
 * again on a slow backoff (2, 4, 8, 15, then every 30 seconds), and the
 * person never has to find the button. Only one probe is ever in flight.
 *
 * Plain ES5 in one closure, no network request of its own beyond the retry
 * probe, so it runs from the binary with the radio switched off.
