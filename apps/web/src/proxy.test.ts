/**
 * The nonce contract, which nothing held.
 *
 * `lib/security/security.test.ts` proves the SHAPE of the policy string. This
 * file proves the other half, which is the half that kills a deployment: that
 * the nonce the proxy names in `script-src` is the same nonce it forwards to
 * the app on `x-nonce`.
 *
 * Why that is the whole product rather than a detail. Under `'strict-dynamic'`
 * a browser stops honouring `'self'` and every host in the directive and runs a
 * script only if it carries this request's nonce. Next reads the policy off the
 * request it is handed and stamps that nonce onto every script it emits: the
 * bootstrap, the chunk preinits, the streaming payload. The root layout reads
 * `x-nonce` and stamps its own three before-paint scripts by hand. If those two
 * values ever disagree, or if either goes missing, EVERY script on EVERY route
 * is refused, nothing hydrates, and the pages still render perfectly in a
 * screenshot because the server markup is already on screen. That is the exact
 * failure this platform has now paid for twice in development clothes.
 *
 * Measured on a production server on 19 September before this file was written:
 * the nonce in the response policy, the nonce on the layout's theme script and
 * the nonce on Next's bootstrap script were one value on every route walked, so
 * the contract held. Nothing was asserting it.
 *
 * These run against the pass-through exit, which is the one a request takes
 * when Supabase is not configured, because that needs no credentials. The
 * policy is stamped by `withSecurityPolicy` on all three exits, so what is
 * proved here is the stamp itself.

/* ==========================================================================
 * THE GATE ITSELF, WHICH NOTHING IN THIS FILE USED TO TOUCH.
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * Every test above runs through the pass-through exit, the one a request takes
 * when Supabase is not configured, because that needs no credentials. That is
 * correct for the nonce contract and it means THE GUARD HAD NO TEST AT ALL:
 * the branch that decides whether a stranger sees the platform was never
 * entered by this suite.
 *
 * It cannot be entered here either. Arming the guard needs `getUser()` to
 * answer, which is a network call to a project this container's egress proxy
 * refuses. So the split is deliberate and is stated rather than papered over:
 *
 *   here             the DECISION, `isPublicPath`, against every route that
 *                    exists, read off the filesystem rather than restated.
 *   gate.spec.mjs    the BEHAVIOUR, a real browser against a real server with
 *                    the guard armed, watching requests bounce.
 *
 * Neither half is the other. A green run here proves the rule is right about
 * the routes we have; it proves nothing about whether the middleware runs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WOULD REPORT ON AN EMPTY LIST, asked before the assertions were
 * written: "every route is classified" is trivially true of no routes, and
 * "nothing public leaked" is trivially true of nothing. So the list's SIZE and
 * a handful of routes known to exist are checked first, and the file refuses
 * rather than passes if the walk came back thin.
