/**
 * Refresh the Supabase auth session on every request, and hold the door on the
 * product.
 *
 * Supabase access tokens are short-lived; without a refresh on navigation a
 * signed-in user would silently fall back to anonymous. This reads the user,
 * which rotates the token when needed, and writes the refreshed cookies onto the
 * response. When Supabase is not yet configured the middleware is a pass-through,
 * so the app runs before any credentials are in place.
 *
 * The guard below is the second job, and it is here rather than on the pages
 * because a link is not a lock. The marketing site used to point straight at
 * `/search`, and removing those links would have stopped the clicks while
 * leaving every one of these routes open to anybody who typed the address,
 * followed an old link, or read the sitemap. One check, before any page runs.
 *
 * It is not the ONLY check, and it must never be treated as one. Every server
 * action resolves its own session and every read is behind RLS, because a
 * server action is posted to a page's path and a caller can choose a path this
 * gate leaves open. The middleware decides who gets a screen. The action and
 * the policy decide who gets a row.

/**
 * WHAT CHANGED ON 23 SEPTEMBER, AND WHY THE LIST IS THE OTHER WAY UP NOW.
 *
 * The founder's instruction, in his own words: "Remove look around. You must
 * sign in. Nothing inside the platform is visible without signing up or
 * signing in."
 *
 * This file used to hold the closed list: a set of product first segments,
 * with everything else open. That shape answers the wrong question. A route
 * added to the app was PUBLIC until somebody remembered to classify it, and
 * "we forgot" is how a product quietly reopens. The same lesson was paid for
 * one layer down this morning, where a rule that lived in prose rather than in
 * a check took the whole catalogue off the air for eleven and a half hours
 * (ledger section 67): the knowledge was in the repository in three places and
 * the migration shipped anyway.
 *
 * So the list is inverted. PUBLIC is now the enumerated set and everything
 * else needs a session, which makes a new route BORN LOCKED, the same rule
 * rule 21 puts on a database function. Getting this list wrong in the closing
 * direction is a compliance problem rather than a bug, which is why every
 * entry below carries the reason it is there and why
 * `apps/web/tests/gate.spec.mjs` walks all of them with a real browser.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ACCEPTED WITH IT, so nobody files either as a defect.
 * No listing will be indexed by any search engine, so the landing page is our
 * only public surface: `app/sitemap.ts` therefore publishes no listing URL.
 * And both app stores need reviewer credentials, which makes the seeded demo
 * account a hard requirement rather than a convenience. Both are written up in
 * `docs/STORE_SUBMISSION_NOTES.md`.
 */

/**
 * Open to anybody, matched on the FIRST path segment.
 *
 * Matched on the segment rather than by prefix string, so `/terms` is public
 * and a future `/termsheet` is not public by accident.
 *
 * THE LANDING PAGE AND WHAT SURROUNDS IT. `/` is the founder's named public
 * surface. `about`, `careers`, `contact`, `help` and `docs` are the company
 * and support pages that hang off its footer: they are not inside the
 * platform, and a support page behind a login is a support page the one person
 * who most needs it cannot reach. `/help` additionally mounts the support chat
 * that `/api/support` answers, which is why that endpoint is open below.
 *
 * THE LEGAL AND POLICY PAGES. `terms`, `privacy`, `eula`, `cancellations`,
 * `standards`, `safety`. A privacy notice nobody can read without an account
 * is not a privacy notice. A regulator, an app store reviewer and a person who
 * has lost access to their account must all be able to reach every one of
 * these without signing in.
 *
 * `delete-account` IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IT IS NOT MARKETING. Google Play
 * requires a publicly reachable URL explaining how to request account deletion
 * that works without installing anything and without signing in. It also
 * carries the restore form, which is the one step a person CANNOT perform
 * signed in, because their account is banned for the length of the grace
 * window. Closing this page would lock somebody out of undoing their own
 * deletion.
 *
 * THE DOORS. `sign-in`, `sign-up`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`, `auth`
 * (which is where every confirmation link lands, and a session is the thing it
 * is about to create) and `start` (the old intro address, a 307). A lock with
 * no door is a wall.
 *
 * `welcome` IS THE FRONT DOOR. First run is the first thing a stranger meets,
 * from the stores and from Sign up or Sign in, so it must answer signed out.
 * It has moved from the closed list to this one and it means the same thing.
 *
 * `offline` is served when there is no network at all, so it cannot depend on
 * an auth call, and `home-or-landing` resolves the word "home" by reading the
 * caller's own cookies and answers `/` for a stranger, which is the honest
 * answer and would become a redirect loop if it were gated.
 *
 * `preview` and `gallery` STAY OUT OF THE GATE ON PURPOSE. They carry their
 * own guard, `previewHarnessIsOpen`, which answers not-found on Vercel
 * unconditionally and off Vercel unless `VALLO_PREVIEW_HARNESS=1`. Gating them
 * as well would break every proof walk in `scripts/design/`, which runs signed
 * out by necessity, and would buy nothing in production where they do not
 * exist.

 *                      and Supabase's own auth hook. The sender has no cookie
 *                      and never will.
 *   cron               a bearer secret through `lib/cron/run.ts`, including
 *                      `/api/push/drain`, which pg_net calls every five
 *                      minutes, and `/api/paystack/reconcile`.

 *                      would mean the only reports we ever received came from
 *                      people who were already signed in.

 *                      service worker registration.
 *   support            `/api/support` answers the chat mounted on the PUBLIC
 *                      `/help` page. Somebody locked out is exactly who needs
 *                      it.
 *
 *   the VAPID key  `/api/push/key` answers the PUBLIC half of the key pair,
 *                      and a browser cannot call `pushManager.subscribe`
 *                      without it. Gating it was a real defect: on 23
 *                      September the founder tried to register the first
 *                      device this platform has ever had and got
 *                      `{"error":"Sign in to use this."}` from inside a home
 *                      screen web app, which keeps its own cookie store and so
 *                      had no session. The route's own header said all along
 *                      that "publishing it is the intended use, not a leak",
 *                      and its variable is literally named `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
 *                      Two parts of this codebase disagreed about one route
 *                      and the wall won. It is open now and the three that
 *                      matter stay shut.
 *
 * Closed by absence, and checked: `/api/assistant`, `/api/crypto/*`,
 * `/api/documents/[id]`, `/api/map/listings`, `/api/push/register`,
 * `/api/push/revoke` and `/api/push/self-test`. Those three write or send;
 * the key only tells a browser who to bind a subscription to. So is
