/**
 * THE INACTIVITY TIMER, AROUND AN UNLOCKED PAGE. docs/PASSCODE.md.
 *
 * Mounted by the (app) layout only when the server has already decided the
 * session is unlocked. It locks again, on this side at once and on the
 * server through `lockPasscodeAction`, when:
 *
 *   - the tab is new (no mark in sessionStorage), unless the member signed in
 *     moments ago, in which case the unlock is minted instead;
 *   - nothing has been touched, typed or scrolled for five minutes;
 *   - the page was hidden (another app, another tab, the phone locked) for
 *     five minutes or more.
 *
 * While the member is active it posts `/api/passcode/touch` at most once a
 * minute, which slides the server's fifteen-minute unlock; an answer of
 * `locked` (the cookie lapsed, or another tab locked) locks this tab too.
 *
 * The lock is drawn here first, over inert children, so nothing is readable
 * while the network answers. The server is the boundary: the lock action
 * clears the cookie, Next re-renders the route (a cookie written by a server
 * action does that), the layout then draws its own lock screen in place of
 * the page, and every money action refuses until a right code.
 *
 * A COPY THE PHONE KEPT (13 October 2026). The service worker now opens the
 * last screen at once from the phone (`public/sw.js`), and that copy was
 * rendered while this session was unlocked. So: the wrapper is marked
 * `data-passcode-guarded`, and `app/css/passcode.css` keeps it out of sight
 * on a kept copy until this guard has decided (`data-guard-ready` on the
 * root), and while it is locked; and a kept copy's `mint` is never honoured,
 * because it describes the sign-in that copy was rendered after, not this
 * one. A new tab therefore still meets the lock, as it always did.
