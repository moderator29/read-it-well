/**
 * Comments, as a sheet.
 *
 * A sheet rather than a list under the post, because reading a story and
 * reading what people said about it are two different activities and putting
 * them on one scroll makes both worse. The sheet has a header that names it, an
 * add control on the left, a close on the right, the comments themselves, and a
 * composer pinned to the bottom where a thumb already is.
 *
 * **The connector is the one thread line in this product, and it is here on
 * purpose.** The owner cut the connecting line from the feed and it stays cut
 * there: it made the feed read as an information-design exercise. Inside this
 * sheet a nested reply at this density is genuinely unreadable without it, so
 * one very faint brand-tinted curve runs from a parent down into its child. It
 * is drawn inside the child's own row and stops at the avatar, so it can never
 * cross a card boundary or thread two unrelated comments together.
 *
 * **The sheet knows nothing about where its rows came from.** It is handed
 * rows, a way to send one and a way to like one, so the same component serves a
 * story's `story_comments` and a post's replies. Those are two different tables
 * with two different sets of policies, and a component that knew which was
 * which would be a third place for them to drift apart.
