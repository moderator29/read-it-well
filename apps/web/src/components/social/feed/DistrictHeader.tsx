 * The head of a district feed.

 * The place name is the title and it is also the control: a chevron beside it
 * opens the other places somebody is in, because the question "am I looking at
 * the right district" is asked far more often than any other on this screen,
 * and answering it should not cost a trip back to a directory.
 *
 * **There is no filter button beside it, and there was one.** It carried a
 * sliders glyph and the accessible name "Filter what you see", and what it
 * actually did was jump the chip row to Apartments. The chip row sits directly
 * underneath, is always visible, names all five kinds and carries their counts,
 * so the button was a second control for a job already done, doing it worse and
 * describing itself wrongly. Neither of those survives a read.
 *
 * Only places the person is actually in are listed. Offering every open place
 * here would make this a directory wearing a header, and the directory already
 * exists at `/around`, which is where the last row goes.
