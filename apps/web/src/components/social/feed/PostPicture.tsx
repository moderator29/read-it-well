/**
 * A PICTURE ON A POST THAT NEVER JUMPS AND ARRIVES SOFTLY (A.5: "media that
 * never jumps. Reserved space, blur up, no layout shift").
 *
 * The space is the grid's: every layout in `.nf-post__media` is a fixed shape,
 * so the card is its final height before a byte arrives. This adds the blur
 * up. Until the picture has decoded, the element shows its own background
 * through a 14px blur: a 32px copy of the same picture from the image
 * optimiser where the source can be optimised (our own assets, a public
 * listing photo), and the inset ground where it cannot. When the full picture
 * has loaded, the blur settles out on `glide` (`social-feed.css`, `.nf-pic`).
 *
 * WHY NOT A LOW-RES COPY FOR EVERY PICTURE. A member's own photographs are
 * signed URLs against a private bucket. Running one through the optimiser
 * would cache a private photograph behind a URL that outlives its signature
 * (the reason `RemoteImage` exists), so those blur up from the ground, not
 * from a copy. Nothing about that is faked: there is simply no copy to show.
 *
 * It is `next/image` directly rather than `RemoteImage` only because the
 * shared wrapper does not pass `onLoad`; the optimise decision is the same
 * function it uses.
