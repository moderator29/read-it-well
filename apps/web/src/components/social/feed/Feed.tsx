            THE CARD NO LONGER UNFOLDS A COMPOSER, AND IT USED TO.

            Tapping the reply glyph opened a text box under the card, in the
            feed, with the conversation you were joining still collapsed to a
            single reply count above it. So the one moment a person most needs
            to see what has already been said is the one moment this hid it,
            and the reply they wrote was written blind.

            It goes to the thread now, with `?reply=1`, which opens the post
            with every answer under it and the composer focused and already
            addressed. That is one tap, the same as before, and it lands
            somewhere with a URL: the back button returns to the feed, the
            address can be sent to somebody, and a reload does not lose a
            half-written reply's context.

            The old comment defended this as "no new page, no lost scroll
            position". Scroll position is worth less than knowing what you are
            replying to.
