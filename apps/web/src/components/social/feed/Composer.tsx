/**
 * Writing something.
 *
 * One component for both jobs, because a reply is a post with a parent and
 * splitting them would mean two composers to keep in step. The `parentId` prop
 * is the only difference a person can see, and it changes the words rather than
 * the mechanics.
 *
 * The honest bit: when the scanner holds a post, this says so plainly instead
 * of showing a success. A composer that says "posted" for something only its
 * author can see has lied, and the person then spends the afternoon wondering
 * why nobody replied.
 *
 * **Pictures, and the order they force.**
 *
 * A picture's object lives at `<author>/<post>/<file>`, because
 * `private.social_media_access` resolves it back to the post that decides who
 * may see it out of that second folder segment. So the post has to exist before
 * anything is uploaded, and the sequence is: write the post, upload, write the
 * `post_media` rows. A database trigger refuses any other path shape.
 *
 * That order has one consequence worth being honest about, and this component
 * is honest about it: if the upload fails, the words are already up. It says
 * exactly that, keeps the pictures, and offers to send them again to the post
 * that already exists rather than pretending nothing happened or writing the
 * words twice.
 *
 * Every picture is redrawn on the device first, through the same canvas
 * re-encode the listing wizard, the avatar, the cover and the story composer
 * use. A camera photo carries EXIF and on a phone that usually means GPS, and
 * this is a photograph of somebody's own street. A re-encode that fails REFUSES
 * rather than falling back to the original file.
