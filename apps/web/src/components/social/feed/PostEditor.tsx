/**
 * Fixing what you wrote.
 *
 * In place inside the card rather than on a page of its own, because an edit is
 * almost always a typo and sending somebody to another screen to change one
 * letter is the kind of thing that makes people give up and post again instead.
 *
 * Two honest states most editors skip.
 *
 * The window closing is a real outcome and gets a real sentence. Fifteen minutes
 * is enforced by `posts_update_own`, and a page that has been open for twenty of
 * them will offer this and be refused; the refusal says what happened rather
 * than "something went wrong".
 *
 * An edit is rescanned. `posts_scan` fires on UPDATE as well as INSERT, so a
 * change that introduces an account number holds the post exactly as a new one
 * would. When that happens this says so plainly, because a post that quietly
 * stopped being visible after an edit is the worst possible way to find out.
