/**
 * ONE BARE GLYPH (D79, the founder on 7 October: "the wrapper you put on all
 * the icons, remove it"). A thin outline glyph at 20px and a tabular count
 * beside it, no capsule, no disc; the 44px target is the button's own box
 * (`GOVERNING-feed-plus-bloom` draws the row exactly so). The name is kept
 * so the thread, comments and stories did not have to change. The same
 * control serves the post card, the thread, a comment and a story, so the
 * like you press in one place is the like you press everywhere.
 *
 * `round` is a glyph with no count: the send and the save at the end of the row.
 *
 * THE PAYOFF. `payoff` marks a toggle whose turning ON is a moment (the
 * like): the capsule pops 1.0, 1.04, 1.0 over 180ms (A.5) and the glyph
 * fills. It plays only on the tap that turns it on, never for a mark that was
 * already on when the card loaded, and never under reduced motion, Calm or
 * Off (`feed-m.css` holds the settled frame).
