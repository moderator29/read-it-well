/**
 * THE FLAT ON A POST, AND WHY IT IS NOT F3's `ListingCard`.
 *
 * The rule is that a listing card on any surface comes from the one shared
 * component and is never forked. This is not that card and cannot be: it
 * takes `PostListing`, which is the eight-field projection
 * `lib/social/posts-queries.ts` returns for a listing attached to a post,
 * and `ListingCard` takes a whole `Listing` (photos, facts, market, price
 * model, save state). `lib/` is read-only from here, so adopting the shared
 * card needs that query widened first; it is filed as a finding rather than
 * worked around by copying the catalogue card's anatomy into this file.
 *
 * SO IT IS A COMPACT ATTACHMENT, ONE TAP, NO SECOND PRIMARY. The plate used to
 * be a wide photograph, a title, a place, a large figure and a lit "See the
 * place" button: a second primary on a card whose primary is the post, and
 * the clutter A.5 names. It is now one row inside a quiet inset: a square
 * thumbnail (reserved, blur-up), the title and the place, the figure set
 * tabular on the right, and a chevron. The whole row is the link, so the way
 * in is the attachment itself, as on every product people already know.
