 * MORE THAN ONE PICTURE: A RAIL, NEVER A CRAMPED GRID (the founder's feed set,
 * 7 October: "if someone wants to post more than 1, 2 or 3 things it should
 * be able to scroll sideways like that, clean UX smart and sharp").
 *
 * Each picture is a tall rounded card at about 80% of the card's width, with
 * the next one peeking at the edge so the reader can see there is more;
 * swiped sideways, snapping card by card. A small smoked-glass counter in the
 * corner says where you are ("2 / 3") and is announced politely. The rail
 * bleeds to the card's own edge so the peek is real, and it is a native
 * scroller, so it moves under the finger at the finger's speed on every
 * platform and Android's back gesture is untouched.
 *
 * Every card has its space before its bytes arrive (a fixed 4:5), and each
 * picture blurs up on its own (`PostPicture`).
