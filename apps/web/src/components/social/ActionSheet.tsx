/**
 * The sheet behind a card's `…`.
 *
 * It is the platform's illustrated action sheet (north star 15.2, reference
 * 43): a clay object on a soft ground, a title, one line, then hairline rows
 * each with a round glyph plate, the action and the sentence that says what it
 * actually does, and one quiet dismiss. It used to be a generic list in a plain
 * `Sheet`, which is exactly the pattern 15.2 says this component replaces.
 *
 * Every row carries a title AND the sentence that says what it does, because
 * "Hide" and "Not interested" and "Mute" are three words people cannot tell
 * apart and the difference between them matters: one is about a post, one is
 * about a feed, one is about a person. The sentence rides in the row's `hint`.
 *
 * **The rows change with what was tapped.** A person's post does not offer
 * "Contact Agent", because there is no agent to contact, and a control that
 * cannot work should not be there to press. What is offered is decided by the
 * caller and passed in, so this component holds no knowledge of what a post is.
 *
 * Everything about being a sheet (drag or flick to close, Escape, Back, the
 * focus trap and return, the counted scroll lock, the home-indicator inset, a
 * body that scrolls when ten two-line rows are taller than a phone held
 * sideways) is `Sheet`'s, inherited through `ActionSheetIllustrated`. A danger
 * row takes the rose plate and label and never glows.
