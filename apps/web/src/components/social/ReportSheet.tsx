/**
 * Reporting something, with a reason.
 *
 * Before this existed, both report paths in the product sent `reason: "OTHER"`
 * the instant somebody chose Report from a menu. That is two separate defects
 * wearing one coat: a queue where every item says "Something else" cannot be
 * triaged, and a destructive-feeling action that fires on the first tap with no
 * way back is a control people learn not to touch.
 *
 * So: the platform's `Sheet` at its near-full height, because choosing why is
 * the whole job and it deserves the screen, and because the sheet brings the
 * drag and flick to close, Back, Escape, the focus trap and the safe areas
 * that a hand-built panel here did not have. One reason, chosen deliberately. An optional sentence, because the
 * category is rarely the whole story. And a confirmation that says what happens
 * next, including the part people actually worry about, which is whether the
 * person being reported gets told.
 *
 * The sheet knows nothing about what it is reporting. It is handed a `submit`
 * that closes over the target, so the same component serves a post, a profile
 * and whatever the next reportable thing turns out to be.
