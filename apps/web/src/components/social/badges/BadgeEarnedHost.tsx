 * year ago is not congratulated for it today, and an older earned badge is
 * simply remembered so it never plays by accident. A hand-given badge is never
 * shown here; the model refuses it.
 *
 * "Shown" is kept on this device (a per-viewer convenience): the server has no
 * notion of a badge having been seen, and inventing one is Session 2's. The
 * worst case of a cleared store is that a recent badge plays once more, which
 * is a true celebration of a true thing.
 *
 * It waits a beat after the page has painted so it arrives over a settled
 * screen rather than competing with the hero's own entrance.
