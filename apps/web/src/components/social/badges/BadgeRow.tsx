/**
 * THE BADGE ROW: at most six, each one a claim with a reason.
 *
 * Reference 7111 (eighty rainbow badges) is the pattern this refuses. The row
 * shows the six the model picks (`pickBadges`), each a clay mark and a name on
 * a Plate; tapping one says what it means, in the database's own words, and
 * when it was granted. For the OWNER, an earned badge opens the earned moment
 * instead, so the thing they worked for is the thing they can show; for
 * anybody else, and for a badge somebody at Vallo gave by hand, it is a sheet
 * and never a celebration.
 *
 * A hand-given badge says so on its own tile ("Given by the Vallo team") so
 * that earned and given are told apart by a word, not by a colour.
 *
 * It draws nothing when there is nothing true to draw: no empty shelf, no
 * "no badges yet", no greyed-out badges to unlock, because a locked badge is an
 * advertisement for a game this product is not.
