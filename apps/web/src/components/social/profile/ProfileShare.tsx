/**
 * Share, floating on the cover beside the `…`.
 *
 * **Why this position is not a bookmark, settled here so it is not reopened.**
 * The reference board draws a bookmark in this corner. On RentMe a bookmark
 * already means one exact thing and has meant it since the day `saved_items`
 * shipped: keep this FLAT so I can find it again. The same glyph on a post is
 * a `post_reactions` row with the mark `SAVE`. Neither of those is a person.
 *
 * The thing a person is asking for when they reach for a bookmark on somebody's
 * page is "let me come back to them", and this product answers that with
 * Follow, which is one tap away on the same screen, writes a real row, has a
 * real list behind it at `/u/[handle]/following`, and tells the other person.
 * A second, private "saved people" pile would need its own table, its own
 * policy and its own screen to read it back, and until all three exist it is
 * half a feature wearing a familiar icon. So the corner carries the two things
 * that genuinely act on a page rather than on a person: send it to somebody,
 * and everything else.
 *
 * The Web Share API where the device has one, which on a phone is the sheet
 * people already know, and the clipboard everywhere else. A share control that
 * only works on a phone is one that most of a desktop audience finds broken.
