/**
 * The cover, and the photo of you.
 *
 * Both are re-encoded through a canvas before they are uploaded, which strips
 * every piece of metadata including the GPS tag a phone camera writes. If the
 * re-encode fails for any reason the file is REFUSED rather than uploaded as it
 * came, because a geotagged photo in a public bucket tells the internet where
 * somebody sleeps.
 *
 * The cover belongs to the social profile and lives in `social-covers`. The
 * photo of you does not: it is the one avatar this person has everywhere on the
 * platform, it lives in `avatars`, and a definer trigger projects it onto the
 * social profile whenever it changes. Uploading a second, social-only avatar
 * would be silently undone by that projection on the very next profile save, so
 * this control writes the real one through the account's own action.

            an avatar, so the only way to discover that your own photo is
            editable was to tap a picture on the off chance. Every product that
            does this puts a small camera badge on the corner, and the reason it
            is a convention is that it works: it is the one element on the
            header that tells you the image is yours to change.

            `pointer-events-none` because the parent is already the button; a
            nested interactive element inside a button is a second control the
            browser has to arbitrate.
