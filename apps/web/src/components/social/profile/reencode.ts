/**
 * Re-encode a chosen photo before it ever leaves the phone.
 *
 * A camera photo carries EXIF, and on a phone that usually includes GPS. A
 * cover and an avatar both serve from PUBLIC buckets, so uploading the original
 * file would publish the coordinates of wherever it was taken to anyone who
 * downloads the image. For a photo of your own street that is your address.
 *
 * Drawing the image onto a canvas and exporting it produces pixels with no
 * metadata at all, so the tag cannot survive. If anything about the re-encode
 * fails this returns null and the caller REFUSES rather than falling back to
 * the original file: publishing a geotagged photo is worse than asking somebody
 * for another one.
 *
 * The same technique is already used by `stripMetadata` in the listing wizard
 * and by `downscaleToSquare` on the account profile. This is a third caller
 * rather than a third rule, and the three should be hoisted into one shared
 * module the next time anybody is in all of them.
