/**
 * The `…` on a person's page. The sibling of the one on every card.
 *
 * Copy link, mute, report, block. Share is its own round control beside this
 * one on the cover, because sending somebody a person's page is a thing people
 * do often enough to deserve a tap rather than two. The rest are the same
 * actions the card menu calls, and that is the point: blocking somebody from
 * their page and blocking them from something they wrote must be the same
 * block, or one of the two quietly becomes a different feature.
 *
 * Every one of these takes a USER id. The post menu learned this the hard way,
 * where passing a post id would have blocked a uuid that is nobody, reported
 * success, and changed nothing at all.
 *
 * **Blocking from here needs somewhere to land, and that is the whole reason
 * this component is more than a popover.** `social_profiles_select` carries
 * `not private.blocked_with(user_id)` bidirectionally, so the instant the block
 * row is written this page stops existing for the person who wrote it: a
 * refresh would drop them onto the "nothing to show here" screen with no
 * explanation, which reads as the app having lost the person they just acted
 * on. So the block is confirmed first, and then the page is replaced by a
 * designed answer that says what happened, what it means, and offers to undo
 * it. No navigation, no 404, and the undo is real: `unblockUser` deletes the
 * row and the page comes back.
