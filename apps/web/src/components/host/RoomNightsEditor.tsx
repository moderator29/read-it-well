/**
 * HOW MANY ROOMS ARE ON SALE, AND FOR WHICH NIGHTS.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. `stays_search` treats a night with no `room_inventory` row
 * as NOT OFFERED rather than as available, which is the right reading and the
 * reason a hotel with no rows cannot be found by anybody who types dates. The
 * table has existed since M5 and nothing in the application ever wrote to it,
 * so every hotel on the platform was in exactly that state and no host could
 * see it. This is where a host sees it and changes it.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS ON THE SCREEN ARE COUNTED, NEVER INFERRED. "Bookable for the
 * next 312 nights" is the count of rows from today onwards, read by
 * `getMyRoomTypes`. A room type with no rows says so in those words rather
 * than being drawn as a zero, because zero open rooms is a closure a host
 * chose and no rows at all is a hotel nobody can find, and the two must never
 * look the same.
 *
 * ZERO IS A CLOSURE AND IT IS OFFERED AS ONE. Setting none open across a run
 * of nights is how a host closes for a refurbishment, and the server writes
 * rows saying so rather than deleting them, so the closure is a recorded
 * decision the host can see and undo.
