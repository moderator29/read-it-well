 * THE HOST DESK'S INNER PAGES, ONE PULL AWAY (D25, COMPONENT_LIBRARY "Glass
 * navigation": "the host and agent workspaces, inside calendar, decide,
 * rooms, earnings").
 *
 * The overview at `/host` answers "what needs me and how am I doing"; each of
 * these answers one question completely, on its own page. A host working the
 * day moves between them (answer a request, open the nights it asked for,
 * see what it paid) and this lets them do it from inside the inner page,
 * without walking back through the overview or scrolling the desk's full
 * chip row. It never replaces the dock, the sidebar or the chip row (D28):
 * it is the second level, drawn only on these five pages.
 *
 * A thin client wrapper so the server pages pass plain words; the pull, the
 * spring, the haptic and the keyboard are `InnerNav`'s.
