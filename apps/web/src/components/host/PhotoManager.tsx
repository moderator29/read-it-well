/**
 * AN OWNER'S PHOTOGRAPHS, ONE SURFACE FOR BOTH SPINES.
 *
 * WHAT WAS TRUE BEFORE THIS. `business_photos` had a manager at
 * `/host/photos` and `accommodation_photos` had none at all, although its
 * table, its bucket, its four storage policies and its catalogue trigger were
 * built in M3. So a restaurant could send its pictures and a hotel could not,
 * while the submission gate in `lib/host/onboarding.ts` refuses an
 * accommodation with no photograph. Every hotel and every shortlet filled in
 * nine steps and could never press send.
 *
 * WHY ONE COMPONENT RATHER THAN A SECOND COPY. The act is identical on both
 * spines: put the object in the same public bucket under the person's own uid
 * prefix, then have a server action record the path after checking that prefix
 * again. The tables differ only in which owner helper RLS consults. A second
 * copy of this file is how the two surfaces come to disagree about the cover,
 * the ceiling or the refusal wording, and the two upload ceilings already
 * disagreed once across layers. `BusinessPhotoManager` and
 * `AccommodationPhotoManager` are the two named doors onto this one body.
 *
 * THE UPLOAD IS THE DOCUMENT UPLOADER'S TWO-STEP, for its reasons: the browser
 * puts the object in the bucket, storage RLS enforces the uid prefix, and the
 * server records the path only after checking that prefix itself. A person who
 * closes the tab keeps every photograph that finished.
 *
 * THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH IS THE COVER, and the screen says so rather than
 * offering a control that cannot be built honestly yet: position is unique per
 * subject, so a reorder is a swap through a free slot and there is no free slot
 * at ten photographs. Removing the cover promotes the next one, which is a
 * reorder anybody can perform and nobody has to be taught.
