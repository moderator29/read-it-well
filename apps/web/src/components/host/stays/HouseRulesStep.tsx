/**
 * HOUSE RULES AND CANCELLATION. `GOVERNING-11` screen two.
 *
 * WHAT WAS THERE. A textarea labelled "House rules (optional)" and a select
 * labelled "Cancellation policy", both of them buried at the bottom of the
 * hotel's property step. A shortlet host's two most consequential answers, the
 * ones a guest argues about later, were the two least prominent controls in
 * the flow.
 *
 * THE FOUR TOGGLES WRITE SENTENCES, NOT BOOLEANS, and that is the whole design
 * of this screen. `accommodations.house_rules` is text that a guest reads on
 * the stay page. Four new boolean columns would have meant a second place
 * where rules live and a translation back into English at read time; instead
 * each switch owns one line, `lib/host/stays-setup.ts` owns the wording, and
 * `mergeHouseRules` keeps every line the host wrote themselves. A host who
 * typed "The generator runs from 7pm" on the old step still has it after
 * turning a switch off here, which is the failure this function exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * THE THREE CANCELLATION TILES ARE THE PLATFORM'S OWN POLICIES AND NOT THREE
 * WORDS. `GOVERNING-11` draws Flexible, Moderate and Strict with a refund
 * sentence under each. Those sentences are `cancellation_policies.summary`,
 * written once in the database and read here, so nothing on this screen is a
 * refund promise typed into a component. Where the estate publishes fewer than
 * three policies, fewer than three tiles are drawn: an empty tile offering a
 * policy that does not exist would be the invented number rule broken in the
 * most expensive possible place.
