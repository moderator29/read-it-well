/**
 * EXTRA CHARGES. Every charge a guest could be asked for at the door (V-57):
 * a caution deposit, power, cleaning, an extra guest and a visitor, each an
 * amount with its unit or none.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A STEP. The publish gate (`publishAccommodation`) refuses a stay
 * whose five charges are not all answered, and nothing in the application
 * asked for them: an approved hotel or shortlet could not go live until the
 * reviewer chased the host to a screen the host had never been shown. Guests
 * read the same answers before they book, as Booking.com and Airbnb require.
 *
 * The questions are the `/host/arrival` form's own (`ArrivalChargesFields`),
 * held in the wizard so Back does not lose them, and saved through the same
 * `declareArrivalCharges`.
