 * labelled plate, a row, a tile, a stepper, a rule row and a calm note. Every
 * one of them is here once. The alternative, which is what the wizard did
 * before, is each step hand-rolling its own boxes, and the cost of that is
 * visible the moment two screens are put side by side: the property step's
 * group and the rooms step's group were the same object with two paddings.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE OWNS ANY BUSINESS RULE. What a place type means, what a house
 * rule writes into the column, what a band is: all of that is
