 *
 * THE SURFACE THAT DID NOT EXIST, and whose absence was the hardest dead end
 * in the product: `missingFrom` blocks submission when an accommodation
 * carries no photograph, the table and bucket were built in M3, and no
 * application code ever wrote to them. Every hotel and every shortlet stopped
 * at the review step with a requirement nothing could meet.
 *
 * A named door onto `PhotoManager`, exactly as `BusinessPhotoManager` is. This
 * file decides only which table the photographs land in and the words a
 * property host reads. The guidance is a hotel's and a shortlet's rather than
 * a restaurant's, because the picture that sells a room is not the picture
 * that sells a table.
