/**
 * WHAT THE PROPERTY OFFERS. `GOVERNING-10` screen four, the facilities half.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. `accommodation_amenities` has had its
 * table, its owner helper and its RLS since M3 and nothing ever wrote a row,
 * while the stays filter lets a guest ask for wifi, parking or air
 * conditioning by name and the catalogue projection folds the codes into
 * `catalogue_entries.amenity_codes`. So every one of those filters returned
 * nothing for every hotel on the platform. This is the control that fills the
 * table.
 *
 * THE RENDER DRAWS THESE AS TILES AND THEY NOW SHIP AS TILES.
 *
 * They shipped as `nf-chip`, a row of pills, under a note saying the shape law
 * beat the image. That note answered the wrong question. The shape law is
 * about RADIUS, measured as drawn radius over drawn short side: it says a
 * control carrying text is a rounded rectangle and never a capsule, and it has
 * nothing to say about whether a control is a pill-shaped row or a square tile
 * with its mark above its word. `GOVERNING-10` screen four draws a three
 * across grid of tiles, mark over label, and that is a layout the law never
 * ruled on.
 *
 * SO BOTH ARE OBEYED HERE. `.nf-stays-tile` is the render's tile and it is on
 * `--nf-radius-control`, 14px on a tile whose short side is never under 56px,
 * a ratio of a quarter, which is a rounded rectangle by the law's own test.
 *
 * TWO TILES OF THE RENDER ARE ABSENT AND IT IS SAID IN `lib/host/facilities.ts`
 * RATHER THAN QUIETLY: "Restaurant" and "Airport shuttle" have no row in
 * `public.amenities`, so drawing them would be drawing a control that saves
 * nothing. That is the defect the property wizard shipped with, three codes in
 * the interface and none in the table, and it is not repeated here.
