 * table. What is typed is kept on this device between saves (`nf_host_draft`)
 * so a dropped connection loses nothing, and the server's draft wins on
 * arrival because it is what a reviewer will read.
 *
 * WHAT IS HONEST HERE. The property's photographs are uploaded on the
 * property step itself, through `AccommodationPhotoManager`, and the review
 * step names the gap until one is on record. That step used to say photo
 * upload for properties arrived with the next host release, while the
 * submission gate refused an accommodation with no photograph: nine steps
 * filled in and no way to press send. The map pin is two real
 * coordinates, filled from the device's own location on request. The bank
 * account is resolved with the bank before it is saved and the resolved
 * name is what is shown. Submission is `submitHostApplication`, which
 * refuses with the list of what is missing, printed word for word.

   * worse than either, so the drawn one is used throughout.

   * identity document, a payout account and three consents. Drawing four

 * simply go: `missingFrom` refuses to submit a restaurant without it, so
 * deleting the control would have left every restaurant application
 * unsubmittable, which is the exact shape of the defect this build has spent
 * the week removing. It sits under "Your restaurant", which is the screen
 * about the venue rather than the screen about its week.
 */

 * THE RESTAURANT'S PHOTOGRAPHS, ON ITS OWN STEP.
 *
 * `missingFrom` refuses to send a restaurant with no photograph (SUP-17), and

 * photo of the restaurant" with no way to meet it short of finding
 * `/host/photos` by accident. The manager is the one `/host/photos` draws, on
 * the business spine, and `addBusinessPhoto` gates on ownership rather than on
 * the application being editable, so the photographs can also arrive later.
