/**
 * THE APP OPENING: THE PRODUCT ARRIVING, NEVER A LOGO (D68c, 7 October 2026).
 *
 * The founder's rule is absolute: the logo never appears by itself on app
 * open, not as an image, not as an animation, not for 200ms. The opening is
 * the app's own first screen arriving, the way a beautifully built website
 * arrives when you click its link: real structure in frame one, content
 * rising into it, usable almost at once. The logo lockup that used to play
 * here (a glass mark rising, a wordmark following, a door opening on the page
 * at 1350ms) is retired from the startup path entirely.
 *
 * Three inline scripts, all nonce-carrying, none importing anything:
 *
 *   STARTUP_NATIVE_SCRIPT  first thing in <head>. Tells the native splash to
 *                 go through the raw bridge (`window.Capacitor.nativePromise`),
 *                 the earliest moment the document can run script, with no
 *                 import, no frame and no `load` waited for. If the bridge is
 *                 not there yet it looks again every 100ms for three seconds,
 *                 and it sends the hide twice more (400ms and 1200ms) because
 *                 a hide the plugin receives before its own launch view is
 *                 marked visible is silently dropped on iOS. A second hide is
 *                 a no-op. It also starts the BOOT TRACE (below).
 *   STARTUP_GATE_SCRIPT    at the top of <body>. Decides, before paint,
 *                 whether this load plays the opening and which one, then
 *                 runs STARTUP_SCRIPT.
 *   STARTUP_SCRIPT         the opening's controller: the native wait, a tap
 *                 or a key skipping to the settled state, and the release.
 *                 Exported alone because Settings replays the opening with
 *                 it (`MotionSettings`).
 *
 * THE OPENING. `data-splash="on"` on the root, with `data-opening`:
 *
 *   full   the first open of the day (no open recorded in the last
 *          `RETURNING_WITHIN_MS`): about 1,500ms of choreography. The header
 *          and the dock resolve into place from frame one (they are already
 *          there, dim and a few pixels off, never absent), the ground settles,
 *          and the page's own entrances rise after `--nf-splash-hold`, which
 *          is now 160ms rather than a 1,450ms logo hold.
 *   brief  a returning open: about 400ms. The page's own entrances only, at
 *          no hold at all, because a beautiful website does not replay its
 *          entrance on every visit either.
 *
 * The mark appears only where the page itself draws it, at header size,
 * arriving with everything else. Nothing is ever centred on an empty field.
 *
 * NOT AT ALL, ONE SETTLED FRAME: Off, Calm, the splash switch, data saver and
 * the platform's reduced-motion setting. Nor on the console, the auth
 * callback, the API, offline, `/open` or a shared link. Once per browser
 * session (`nf_entered` in sessionStorage), which on the native shell is once
 * per cold start; `nf_entered` in localStorage remembers the last open, which
 * is what makes the next one brief.
 *
 * INTERACTIVE FROM THE FIRST FRAME. Nothing covers the page, so a tap lands on
 * whatever is under the finger and does its job. The same tap (or a key)
 * finishes every running entrance at once (`Animation.finish()`), so the page
 * is settled under the finger rather than still travelling.
 *
 * THE NATIVE WAIT. On the shell, every animation is held at its first frame
 * (`data-startup-native="wait"`, startup.css) until the bridge answers the
 * hide, or `NATIVE_WAIT_MS` at most, so the arrival is not played out of sight
 * beneath the native splash. The splash is now a flat navy field identical to
 * the page's ground, so even a wait that runs out shows nothing but navy.
 *
 * THE RELEASE. `data-splash` moves to "done" after the opening's length and
 * `STARTUP_RELEASE_MS` more, or at once on a skip, and `data-startup` becomes
 * "open". Before it lets go, the hold is pinned on anything marked
 * `data-startup-pin` (the landing hero), whose entrance is timed from it and
 * would otherwise jump when the root's number goes. Everything is wrapped in
 * try: a failure releases the page rather than holding it.
 *
 * THE BOOT TRACE, FOR THE DEVICE WE DO NOT HAVE. The founder has watched a
 * logo for eight seconds on a build where every timer said it should be gone,
 * and nobody here holds his phone. So every stage of the path marks itself:
 * `console.info("[vallo-boot] <stage> +<ms>")`, a `performance.mark` named
 * `nf:<stage>`, and the whole run as one line in `localStorage.nf_boot_trace`
 * (also `window.__nfBoot`), on the shell only (its user agent carries
 * VALLO-NATIVE, or the bridge is there): the website keeps the stages in
 * `window.__nfBoot` and says nothing. `lib/native/boot-trace.ts` adds the stages the
 * native runtime reaches later. Read it from Safari's or Chrome's inspector,
 * or surface `nf_boot_trace` on a diagnostics row.
