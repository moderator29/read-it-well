/**
 * THE CONNECTION LINE (details pass; offline pass, 8 October 2026). A small
 * dark pill at the top of the screen, never a wall: the page under it stays
 * the page, and everything on it that works without the network still works.
 *
 *   offline   the phone says it has no signal. The page on screen is the one
 *             this phone kept (`public/sw.js`), so the line says so: "You are
 *             offline. Showing what you saw last."
 *   kept      the phone has signal, but the network was too slow to wait for,
 *             so the worker answered with the kept copy and carried on
 *             fetching. The line says that, and the moment the fresh copy
 *             lands the page refreshes itself in place and the line goes.
 *   back      the connection returned: green for two seconds, and the page
 *             it was showing from the phone is refreshed in place.
 *
 * THE INSTANT OPEN (13 October 2026, the startup track). The worker now
 * answers a whole, recent copy AT ONCE and refreshes it behind the screen
 * (`public/sw.js`, "instant"). That is the normal way to open the app, not a
 * fault, so the line says nothing: the page refreshes itself in place the
 * moment it runs, inside a transition, so what is on screen stays on screen
 * until the fresh render replaces it. Only when that refresh is still going
 * after INSTANT_SLOW_MS does the line say what the slow answer says, and only
 * when the phone is offline does it say offline. Behind the passcode lock the
 * refresh is left to the unlock, which refreshes the route itself.
 *
 * `navigator.onLine` is optimistic (true behind a captive portal), so this
 * only speaks of being offline when the browser is sure, and never promises a
 * send will work: a send says so on its own button (`lib/offline/send-or-keep`).
 * The server render reads as online, so nothing flashes on first paint. The
 * words are a polite status, never an alert: being offline is a fact about the
 * place, not a failure of the person.
