 * Money, set the way the reference set sets money.
 *
 * Across the fifteen supplied references the hero figure is always two-tone:
 * the number itself lands at full weight and near-full contrast, and the part
 * that is not the number - the ".00", the "of 300", the "/8hrs", the "/night" -
 * drops to a muted colour at a smaller size. It is a small detail and it is one
 * of the strongest single tells separating a premium product from a competent
 * one.
 *
 * The platform had this exactly once, on the wallet balance. Every other price
 * on the platform - including the listing detail page, which is the screen that
 * sells the product - rendered as flat single-tone text.
 *
 * Two other things this fixes on the way past:
 *
 * 1. Tabular figures. Digits are proportional by default in Inter, so a column
 *    of prices visibly jitters as values change. Every Amount is tabular.
 *
 * 2. Locale-consistent assembly. `formatMoney` returns one opaque string, and
 *    the naira sign was additionally hard-coded in five places. Those disagreed:
 *    ha-NG emits "₦ 9,000,000" with a space, so the wallet hero and the ledger
 *    row directly beneath it rendered the same currency differently. Building
 *    from `formatToParts` means the symbol, the grouping and the spacing all
 *    come from the locale, once, here.
