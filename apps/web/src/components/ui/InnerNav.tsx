/**
 * INNER NAV: GLASS SECOND-LEVEL NAVIGATION WITH A PHYSICAL PULL.
 *
 * Ported from the founder's component library (docs/design/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md,
 * "Glass navigation"). His note, kept verbatim in spirit: this is NOT the main
 * navigation. It is for inner areas, inner features and inner pages, and the
 * pull on the hamburger is the part he likes.
 *
 * WHERE IT GOES: places with their own internal structure. Admin desks (each desk
 * has sections), the host and agent workspaces (calendar, decide, rooms,
 * earnings), settings (inside each screen), the wallet (transactions, methods,
 * statements, limits), escrow (conditions, milestones, evidence, dispute), space
 * detail (overview, costs, amenities, trust, location), analytics, support.
 *
 * WHERE IT MUST NEVER GO: the primary dock and the side navigation. They are
 * settled by D28 (the dock keeps its slots, the side nav keeps its structure) and
 * this component does not replace, wrap or restyle either.
 *
 * THE PULL, which must feel physical. Put a finger on the toggle and drag it
 * down: the toggle follows the finger with resistance, and the panel unfurls in
 * proportion to the pull, 1:1, not on a timer. Let go past halfway (or with a
 * downward flick) and it settles open on the spring (`--nf-ease-spring`, the
 * `drift` curve, `--nf-duration-slow`); let go short and it springs back
 * closed. Drag up from open to close it the same way. Pull past the end and
 * the toggle stretches with a rubber band rather than stopping dead. A tap does
 * the ordinary thing: toggles. The pull is never the only way: the toggle is a
 * real button, so Enter and Space work, Escape closes and returns focus to the
 * toggle, and Tab walks the items.
 *
 * WHY framer-motion, AND HOW (and why no `m` element). The pull is the founder's favourite thing about
 * this component, and it is exactly what CSS is worst at: motion that follows a
 * finger and then inherits it. One `useMotionValue` (`pull`, 0 to 1: how open)
 * and one for the toggle's own travel are written straight from the pointer
 * (no React render per frame); the panel's opacity, lift, scale and visibility,
 * and the menu and close glyphs, are all derived from `pull` with
 * `useTransform`, so everything tracks the finger together. On release `animate`
 * settles it on a spring with the finger's momentum (interruptible: put a finger
 * back on it mid-settle and it carries on from where it is). Pointer events
 * rather than framer's `drag` prop, because `drag` is in the `domMax` bundle and
 * the platform loads `domAnimation` only (MotionProvider). Those values are
 * written into the elements by `useDrive` (ported-motion.ts), not through `m`
 * elements, because `m` renders nothing but its first frame until the lazily
 * loaded features arrive: a tap would "open" a panel that stayed invisible. Open
 * and closed are React state and a data attribute, the panel is hidden by CSS
 * until it is open or being pulled, and the motion values only add the
 * continuous flourish on top, so the control works from its first frame. Quiet
 * readers (system reduced motion, Calm, Off) get an instant open and close; the
 * pull still tracks the finger.
 *
 * HAPTIC: one "select" (light, the grammar's tab and toggle weight) when the
 * panel settles open or closed by a gesture or tap. Nothing while dragging.
 *
 * MATERIAL: the sheet's glass panel, one hairline edge with the lit edge on the
 * leading side, the sheet's lift. Navy at night, white with a hairline on paper.
 * Data saver replaces the blur with a solid surface. Radius 26 (an Island); each
 * item is a Plate at radius 14; the toggle is a circular icon control (44px).
 *
 * LINKS OR ACTIONS. An item with `href` renders a real link (so it can be opened
 * in a new tab and prefetches); one without renders a button and calls
 * `onSelect`. Both close the panel. The active item carries `aria-current`.
 *
 * COPY is the caller's: no string here has a default.
