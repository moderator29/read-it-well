/**
 * One series over days. The console's change-over-time chart.
 *
 * NO CHARTING DEPENDENCY, and the reasoning is measured rather than
 * nostalgic. Every console page is a server component today; every popular
 * charting library's chart is a client component, so adopting one turns each
 * charted desk into a client boundary and ships the desk's data twice, once
 * as HTML and once as the RSC payload for hydration. Our palette lives in CSS
 * custom properties and an SVG `stroke="var(--nf-brand-primary)"` follows a
 * retune of one with no JavaScript, while a canvas library has to resolve the
 * property in JS on the client, which is a flash of the wrong colour. (This
 * used to say "change under `[data-theme="light"]`" and cite a theme listener
 * per chart; light mode was removed on 23 September 2026, so the argument is
 * now about a token moving rather than a theme switching, and it is the same
 * argument.) And every one of
 * them ships a categorical default containing the four banned hues. This is
 * about 2KB and has none of those properties.
 *
 * ONE Y AXIS, EVER. There is no second series parameter and there is not
 * going to be one: two measures of different scale are two charts. That is
 * the single most common charting mistake and the cheapest way to not make it
 * is to build a component that cannot express it.
 *
 * NO LEGEND, and that is correct rather than an omission: identity is never
 * colour alone, and with one series the title names it. A legend box for one
 * series is furniture.
 *
 * THE CLEAN UNIFIED STYLE (29 September 2026, spec section 13): a 1.5px
 * brand line with no area fill, a dashed muted target line only where the
 * product keeps a promise, 4px points and a brand-tint band only on hover,
 * a dark tooltip in both themes, 11px muted axis labels, and no gridlines
 * but the baseline. Material: `.nf-ts` in `app/css/controls.css`.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC GEOMETRY. Every number below is computed from the data, so
 * the server render and the client render are byte-identical and React has
 * nothing to reconcile. `AreaSparkline` established this and it is kept.
