/**
 * THE "IT WORKED" MOMENT (docs/SUCCESS_MOMENTS.md).
 *
 * Founder reference 54 (30 September 2026,
 * `docs/design/references/2026-09-29/54-success-pin-set.jpg`) and reference
 * 7037 (6 October): the whole screen, a big object in the middle, a title and
 * one line under it, the amount and who it was for beneath, and one
 * full-width action at the foot (a rounded rectangle, D2). Drawn in our own
 * hand: the soft top (section 17), one of the founder's 3D objects instead of
 * a flat badge, on a radial wash inside a soft halo ring, with a tick seal
 * that lands on it when the news is finished.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES, ONE BODY.
 *
 *   SuccessSheet    a dialog over whatever the person was doing. On a phone
 *                   it fills the screen; from 40rem up it is a centred card
 *                   over the dimmed page. Everything else is `Sheet`'s: the
 *                   portal, focus trap and return, Escape, Back, scroll lock.
 *   SuccessScreen   the same moment as a page's own content, for a route
 *                   whose whole job is to say it worked. Not a dialog.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT FOR.
 *
 * Good news only. `ResultSheet` keeps every other state: pending, in review
 * with a horizon, failed, expired. A payment is celebrated here only once the
 * server settled it against the booking on screen; "Confirming your payment"
 * is never this component, and there is no prop that makes it one. Small
 * saves (saved, copied) keep their quiet toasts.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MOTION 13, THE FULL-SCREEN SUCCESS (north star 7.1, MOTION_SYSTEM section
 * 2 "payoff moments"; app/css/success.css). Sharp, then settled:
 *
 *   0 to 620ms     a radial wash opens behind the object, and the object
 *                  scales in over it (`land`, 620ms)
 *   at 620ms       the payoff: a tick seal lands on the object with the one
 *                  permitted pop (1.0 to 1.04 to 1.0 over 180ms), one ring
 *                  goes out from it, and ONE haptic is felt, at that moment
 *                  and not on open, so the hand and the eye agree
 *   380 to 920ms   the title, the line, the amount, the facts and the actions
 *                  rise in, 60ms apart, so the amount and the counterparty
 *                  are read beneath the object as it settles
 *
 * Nothing after that moves. The sparks and the five-breath float the first
 * version carried are gone: the motion system allows the pop for confirm,
 * verify, unlock, release and earn and nothing else (principle 5), allows
 * one warm spark per screen where they drew three, and lets nothing loop but
 * the aurora and the assistant. A moment that keeps moving after it has said
 * "done" is decoration, and decoration on a money screen reads as a game.
 *
 * THE TICK IS ONLY WHERE THE WORDS ARE FINISHED. A submission waits on a
 * person, so the "submitted" variant lands its object with no seal and no
 * pop: the picture never claims more than the words.
 *
 * MONEY ARRIVES HERE ONLY AFTER THE SERVER. The caller opens this once a
 * settlement against the record on screen came back (PaymentReturn, the pay
 * panels): there is no prop that turns "Confirming your payment" into this
 * component, and the amount shown is the amount the settlement recorded. The
 * figure itself never counts: it states money that has already moved.
 *
 * Transform and opacity only, on five elements. Under `prefers-reduced-
 * motion`, or the app's Calm or Off setting (`motionQuiet`), the moment lands
 * in its final state, the haptic is felt at once, and nothing moves. The
 * stylesheet answers the same conditions on its own, so a first paint before
 * this script runs is never the animated one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ACCESSIBILITY.
 *
 * The sheet is a real dialog named by the title; the screen carries the
 * title as its heading. The line is announced through a polite live region
 * filled one frame after opening, because a live region that arrives already
 * full is not announced by every reader. In the sheet, focus goes to the
 * primary action; the screen is a page and leaves focus where a page does.
 * The object is decorative: the words say everything.
