/**
 * The consented departure.
 *
 * Nobody leaves Vallo. Where somebody genuinely must, they are told where
 * they are going before they go, by name, and the quiet action is the one
 * that travels.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE THIS IS FOR TODAY is a user's own profile link. "One place
 * people can find you" is the entire feature, so making it not leave would
 * make it nothing, which is why the sweep lists it as unavoidable. What was
 * avoidable is the SURPRISE: until now that chip was a single tap out of a
 * property marketplace into an arbitrary origin, supplied by the account
 * holder, checked by nobody. On a platform where people are already being
 * asked for a NIN, a one tap unannounced jump to a stranger's domain is a
 * phishing route with a verified badge above it.
 *
 * So: the host in full, in its own line, at reading size. A plain sentence
 * saying Vallo has not checked it. Copy as the primary action, because
 * copying is what somebody wants nine times in ten and it costs nothing.
 * Open as the quiet one.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS ON THE SHELL. `Open it anyway` is a real anchor with a real
 * foreign href, so `lib/native/external-links.ts` intercepts it exactly as it
 * intercepts any other outbound anchor and hands it to the in-app tab rather
 * than letting the web view navigate away. Nothing here needs to know that.
