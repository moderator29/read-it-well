/**
 * THE BACK CONTROL. One object, on every screen that has a way back.
 *
 * Founder, 29 September 2026: "all back buttons should all be on professional
 * level". Before this there were eleven hand-drawn back arrows at four glyph
 * sizes (12, 16, 20, 24), three target sizes (40, 44 and a 36 faked up to 44),
 * with "Back" as the only name and two of them calling history directly. Now:
 *
 *   - ALWAYS 44 BY 44, drawn rather than implied (no `nf-tap` pseudo target:
 *     that class is unlayered and its `position: relative` beat the fixed
 *     floating back), with the arrow at 20 (the
 *     `ICON.inline` step, 2.25px rendered stroke per docs/ICON_SYSTEM.md).
 *   - ONE BEHAVIOUR. Without `onBack` it runs `useBack`, so the destination is
 *     `chooseBack`'s (the screen you came from when that is safe, else the
 *     declared parent; `docs/BACK_NAVIGATION.md`). With `onBack` it is a step
 *     back inside one screen (a wizard, a sign-up step) and the caller owns it.
 *   - A NAME THAT SAYS WHERE. "Back to Messages" for an English reader, read
 *     off the destination; the translated `common.back` in every other locale.
 *   - A NATIVE BUTTON, so Enter and Space work, the focus ring is the
 *     platform's, and `data-nav-back` is the one handle the browser walks
 *     (`tests/back-destinations.spec.mjs`, `scripts/design/proof-nav.mjs`) use.
 *
 * `surface` picks the material for where it sits, never the size or the glyph:
 *
 *   bare    no plate: page bars, the console and workspace bars, auth.
 *   plate   the base square (`nf-icon-btn`): the thread and the assistant bars.
 *   glass   the renders' glass square: `PageHeader`, settings, support.
 *   media   over a photograph: the listing gallery, a profile cover, a story.
 *   pill    `media` with the word on it: the profile banner.
