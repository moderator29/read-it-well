/**
 * Form fields.
 *
 * The bug this is shaped around: `.nf-field` paints its border with a
 * `border-box` gradient over a `1px solid transparent` border. The error rule
 * beside it, `.nf-field[aria-invalid="true"] { border-color: … }`, therefore has
 * NO VISIBLE EFFECT - the gradient layer covers the border box, so setting the
 * border's colour changes a surface nobody can see. Validation errors were being
 * computed, `aria-invalid` was being set, and the field looked exactly as it did
 * a moment earlier. A screen reader knew; nobody else did.
 *
 * The fix is not a stronger border colour. It is to stop depending on the border
 * at all: an invalid field replaces the gradient's OWN border-box layer and adds
 * a ring. Written inline here rather than as a rule, so it lands over the
 * gradient without a specificity argument and without this primitive editing
 * globals.css. The keyboard focus ring is an `outline` and so survives the
 * override untouched, which matters - an invalid field is the one a user is most
 * likely to be tabbing back into.
 *
 * What else it owns, because 0 call sites had all of it: the label/control id
 * pairing, `aria-describedby` across hint AND error, `aria-invalid`, the clear
 * affordance (which existed nowhere), a leading icon slot (hand-rolled four
 * different ways across four search bars at three type sizes), and the 16px
 * floor on coarse pointers.
