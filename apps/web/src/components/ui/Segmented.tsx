/**
 * The segmented control.
 *
 * There were five separate implementations on the platform and none of them did
 * what the reference set does. Three hard-swapped the active state with no
 * transition at all; two slid a 2px underline. Not one had the thing the
 * references actually show: a floating capsule with its own shadow that TRAVELS
 * between segments, so the eye follows the selection instead of losing it.
 *
 * The capsule is a single absolutely-positioned element measured against the
 * real segment boxes, which is what makes it work with labels of different
 * lengths and in four locales where the same word can be three times longer.
 * A ResizeObserver keeps it correct through font loading, orientation changes
 * and container resizes rather than measuring once and drifting.
 *
 * TWO VARIANTS (the clean unified sweep, 29 September 2026;
 * `docs/design/CLEAN_UNIFIED_DIRECTION.md` section 7):
 *
 *   quiet  (default) a raised track with a white thumb on the card shadow
 *          (a raised night surface at night), ink on and muted off at 500.
 *          Filters and views: Property / Stays, Buy / Rent / Stay, list / map.
 *   solid  the brand thumb with a white label, lit at night: the ONE
 *          page-level mode switch (Setup / Configure / Test in an editor).
 *
 * THE THUMB SPRINGS (Session 3; north star motion 6, MOTION_SYSTEM.md
 * "Segmented pill"; reference 7064): `drift` 240ms to the chosen segment, by
 * TRANSFORM ONLY. The thumb takes its new width at once and is drawn where it
 * was, as it was (a translate plus a horizontal scale), then released to its
 * new place on the spring: the browser animates one composited transform
 * rather than relaying the track every frame. It is a pill, the one shape D2
 * reserves for a segmented control. Under reduced motion, Calm and Off it
 * jumps. The content under it crossfades 160ms (`SegmentedPanel`).
 * `shape="pill"` is the old name of `solid` and renders it.
