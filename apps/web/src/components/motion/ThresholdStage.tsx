 *
 * Mounted once in the root layout, so it survives the navigation it is
 * covering: the "going" half plays on the page being left, the route changes
 * underneath it, and the "arriving" half plays over the page being entered.
 *
 *   door    A new account, verified. A tick draws, "Welcome to Vallo." comes
 *           out of depth, an arch of light opens from a slit, and the view
 *           moves THROUGH it; on the other side the light falls away and the
 *           first page settles forward out of the glow.
 *   leave   Signing out. The page recedes into depth, two panels close on
 *           the mark, and they part again on the front door.
 *   return  Back after more than ten minutes away. No overlay: the page
 *           settles forward once and a line of light crosses the top. Less
 *           than ten minutes and nothing happens, so it never nags.
 *
 * `playThreshold` (lib/motion/threshold.ts) is how the app asks for one. None
 * of them runs under reduced motion or data saving, and every one is
 * decoration: `aria-hidden`, and `pointer-events: none` once the going half
 * is done, so nothing can be trapped behind it.
