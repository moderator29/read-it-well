/**
 * GOVERNING-03, THE OWNER FORM, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS.
 *
 * Four screens: about you, where do you own, proof of ownership with "I have
 * none of these", and the confirmation. This is the door a landlord who is not
 * an agent and never will be walks through, and until it existed the only way
 * into the supply side of this platform was marked for professionals.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SCREEN THREE IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BUILD
 *
 * Most Nigerian land sits outside the formal register and most landlords hold
 * no title document at all. A form that requires a Certificate of Occupancy
 * therefore turns away the large majority of the people this platform is
 * trying to reach.
 *
 * SO "I HAVE NONE OF THESE" IS A FIRST CLASS ANSWER. Look at what this
 * component does with it and what it does NOT do:
 *
 *   - It is in `OWNERSHIP_ANSWERS` with the other five and it is drawn with
 *     the same row, the same plate, the same ring and the same weight.
 *   - Choosing it does not disable the Continue control, does not add a screen,
 *     does not open a sheet asking whether they are sure, and does not mark the
 *     row in any colour. There is no second chance and no nag, because a nag is
 *     how a form tells somebody they gave the wrong answer.
 *   - It files the same SUBMITTED application as any other answer, through the
 *     same action, with the same reference.
 *   - The ONE thing it changes is the sentence on screen four: the listing will
 *     not carry the ownership mark. That is the only difference there is, and
 *     the person is told it plainly rather than discovering it later.
 *
 * The reassurance beside it is the one `lib/supply/roles.ts` already wrote, so
 * the door's promise and the form's promise cannot drift apart. NEITHER
 * TITLING FIGURE IS PRINTED: both rest on a search summary rather than a
 * primary source and a lawyer confirms them before any number becomes copy.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT SCREEN TWO DOES NOT DRAW, SAID PLAINLY RATHER THAN QUIETLY OMITTED
 *
 * `GOVERNING-03` screen two draws a map with a draggable pin. This screen ships
 * without one and that is deliberate on two grounds. `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY`
 * is unset on this platform, so a map here would be a rectangle of nothing
 * where the render draws a city. And the exact building is a fact about a
 * PROPERTY, which the listing wizard already owns and already asks for; a pin
 * dropped during registration, before any property exists, would be a pin
 * attached to nobody. The state, the local government and the neighbourhood
 * are what a registration can honestly hold, and the screen says where the pin
 * belongs instead of pretending it is not missing.

 * is the one thing it cannot spend.
 *
 * So the composition is the render's, exactly: the glass object on its pool of
 * light, the heading, one line, the panel of three, the timing label and the
 * two controls. The claim is ours and it is true.
 *
 * Exported so the preview harness can draw the real screen rather than a
