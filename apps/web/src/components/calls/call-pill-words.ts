 * THE WORDS OF A CALL PILL IN A THREAD: who called, and what became of it, in
 * one plain line ("Missed video call from Nora", "You called Nora, cancelled",
 * "Video call with Nora, 12 min").
 *
 * Pure and client-safe so the wording is unit tested without a browser. Every
 * word comes from the `chatPolish.calls` dictionary block. A duration is only
 * ever the one the call recorded (`view.seconds`, set by the database when the
 * call connected); a call that never connected, or whose length was not
 * recorded, says no length at all rather than a guess.
