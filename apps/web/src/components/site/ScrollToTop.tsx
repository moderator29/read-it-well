/**
 * Scroll position, the big-app way: forward lands at the top, back lands where
 * you left off.
 *
 * THIS COMPONENT USED TO BE THE BUG. It was four lines that scrolled to
 * `(0, 0)` on every `pathname` change with no idea whether the change was a
 * push or a back, so a person who scrolled a long way down `/search`, opened a
 * place and came back was thrown to the top of the results every single time.
 * The browser had restored the position perfectly well; this component then
 * undid it. Measured on the real page at 390px: leave `/search` at scrollY
 * 502, come back at scrollY 153.
 *
 * The rule now:
 *
 *   push (a link, a form, a filter chip)   land at the top, instantly
 *   pop  (back or forward)                 land where that screen was left
 *
 * KEYED BY THE FULL URL, QUERY INCLUDED. `/search?q=Lagos&beds=2` and
 * `/search?q=Abuja` are two different screens to the person looking at them
 * and they scroll independently. Keying on `pathname` alone would hand one
 * search the other's position, which is worse than not restoring at all.
 *
 * WHY POPSTATE AND NOT A RENDER EFFECT. A `[pathname]` effect never fires when
 * only the query changes, so back from `?q=Abuja` to `?q=Lagos` would not be
 * seen at all. `popstate` fires on every traversal regardless, and by the time
 * it runs `location` already describes the entry being restored.
 *
 * WHY THE RETRY. On a traversal the restored page's markup is not on screen
 * yet, so the document is still short and a single `scrollTo(502)` clamps to
 * whatever currently fits and leaves the reader part-way up. That is precisely
 * the 502-to-153 measurement above. It re-applies for a few frames until the
 * document is tall enough to hold the position, then stops. Bounded, so a
 * genuinely shorter page settles instead of retrying for ever.
 *
 * It also stamps each history entry (`noteEntry`), because this is the one
 * component mounted on every screen in the app. See `lib/ui/history.ts` for
 * why back needed a stamp at all.

 * of that window the document was one viewport tall and every `scrollTo(1384)`
 * clamped to nothing. The budget ran out, the results then arrived 2500px
 * tall, and the reader was left at the top. Left at scrollY 1384, returned to

/**
 * How long a scrolling CHAIN stays open with no further movement, in ms.
 *
 * ONLY A PERSON'S SCROLL IS WORTH REMEMBERING, and getting this wrong was the
 * second bug this component produced, entirely separate from the first.
 * Recording every scroll event looked obviously right and was not: tapping a
 * listing card fires one scroll event to an unrelated position WHILE
 * `location` still says `/search`, with no `scrollTo` behind it and no change
 * in document height, so it is neither a clamp nor anything the reader did.
 * Traced on the real page: leave the search at scrollY 1320, and one event
 * later the stored position for that exact URL is 454. Coming back then
 * restored 454, perfectly correctly. The restore was never the problem.
 *
 * A window measured from the last GESTURE was not enough either, because a
 * person scrolls, pauses half a second, and then taps, which is well inside
 * any window long enough to cover a flick's momentum. So the window is short
 * and it is extended by SCROLLING rather than by gestures: momentum fires a
 * scroll event every frame and keeps its own chain alive, and a chain that has
 * gone quiet cannot be reopened by anything except another gesture.
 *
 * `touchstart` and `pointerdown` are deliberately NOT gestures. Tapping a link
 * is a touchstart, so counting one would re-admit the router's scroll through
 * the front door. Dragging fires `touchmove`; a wheel and a keyboard scroll
 * fire continuously while they move.
