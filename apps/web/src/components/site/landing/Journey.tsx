/**
 * THE JOURNEY: Find, Inspect, Agree, Move in, as four numbered step cards
 * joined by one progress line (the founder's ruling of 29 September: no phone
 * or device frame anywhere on the landing).
 *
 * Each card carries one of the founder's 3D objects, its number on the line, the step's name,
 * a title, one sentence, and a small product fragment: the one or two labels
 * the product itself shows at that step ("Booked", "Approved by Vallo",
 * "Straight to their bank"). The fragment repeats what the sentence says, so
 * it is `aria-hidden`; the sentence carries the meaning.
 *
 * UNDER 40REM IT IS A SIDEWAYS SWIPE ROW (the founder, 29 September: "the
 * four steps must be horizontal and smaller on mobile"): compact cards about
 * three quarters of the screen wide, snapping, the next one peeking in, the
 * numbered line still across the top. Only the row scrolls, never the page.
 *
 * THE LINE FILLS AS THE READER SCROLLS, from CSS alone (landing-rooms.css):
 * from 64rem one horizontal line across the four numbers, on the list's own
 * view timeline; from 40rem to 64rem three vertical segments, number to
 * number, each filling as its own step passes through the view; under 40rem
 * the same three segments laid across, filling as the row is swiped.
 * Where the browser has no scroll timelines, and under reduced motion, the
 * line is simply drawn full. There is no script and nothing is pinned.
 *
 * THE MONEY SENTENCES ARE THE CONSTANTS. Inspect prints `NO_INSPECTION_FEE`,
 * Agree prints `PAYMENT_GATE_SENTENCE` and Move in prints
 * `NO_CUSTODY_SENTENCE`, verbatim from `lib/money/copy.ts`. No fragment
 * carries money copy of its own.
