/**
 * Take Vallo with you: one branded panel, no device frame (the founder's
 * ruling of 29 September removed the drawn phones).
 *
 * The panel is the shared `HeroBand` (navy on paper, a raised night surface
 * at night), so it reads as the brand speaking rather than one more card.
 * On it: the app promise, the store badges or the install line, and three
 * short points on what the phone gives you, divided by hairlines.
 *
 * STORE-06 (also UI-07, UX-26), revised 30 September: the apps launch this
 * week, so the "Add it to your home screen" instructions are gone and the two
 * official badges always show (`store-badges.ts`):
 *
 *   - a badge is a link ONLY when its store URL is set and is that store's
 *     own address (NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_STORE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAY_STORE_URL);
 *   - until then it shows "Coming soon" beneath it and is not a link;
 *   - neither renders inside a native shell, whatever is set (`LandingBody`
 *     passes the surface the server read from the shell's User-Agent, and
 *     leaves this band out entirely there).
