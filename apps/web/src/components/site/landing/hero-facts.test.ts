 * THE HERO'S SHORT LINES MEAN WHAT THE CONSTANTS MEAN (UIUX item 7).
 *
 * The fact row and the eyebrow capsule say the money constants in a few
 * words, and a few words drift. So each short line is pinned to the
 * sentence it shortens: if `NO_INSPECTION_FEE` ever stops saying there is no
 * inspection fee, or the payment gate stops being about the agreement, the
 * short line fails here before the landing says something the product no
 * longer does. None may carry a figure or an unbacked claim.
