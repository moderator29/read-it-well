/**
 * A7. "CHECK BEFORE YOU PAY" AS A FRONT-DOOR FEATURE.
 *
 * `/check` answers "is this a Vallo agent?" for anybody, with no account, and
 * it was linked from nowhere a stranger looks. This card puts the field itself
 * on the landing: paste a number or a VA- code and the answer is drawn in
 * place, through the same rate-limited action the page uses
 * (`lib/doors/agent-check-actions.ts`). A "no match" offers the fixed warning
 * share, which never carries the number.
 *
 * It lives in the community room ("Built for both sides of the deal"), in the
 * column the photograph used to take, rather than in a room of its own: the
 * landing's height budget (A15) and the room's own point, that both sides of
 * the deal can be checked, ask for the same place. One card, the clean
 * unified material (`.nf-pd-card`), one column at every width.
