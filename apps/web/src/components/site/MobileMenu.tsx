/**
 * Marketing side navigation, for phones.
 *
 * SHORT. One grouped surface of rows, the display controls, and one button.
 *
 * What it was: a bare list where every row carried its own bottom border
 * INCLUDING the last one, so the stack ended on a hairline hanging under
 * nothing; an "Display" overline over two loose controls; a "Contact support"
 * line set as a third kind of thing again, at a third size; and the sign-up
 * button wearing `nf-breathe`, a permanent looping pulse on the one control in
 * the panel that did not need help being noticed. Four different row treatments
 * for what is, at most, six destinations.
 *
 * Now: the destinations live in a single glass surface with inset hairlines
 * between them and none at either end, which is the platform's grouped list and
 * the pattern the reference set uses for every panel it has. Support is a row
 * in that group rather than a separate species. The label sits OUTSIDE the
 * surface. The two display controls sit under their own label in the same
 * shape, and the only filled thing in the panel is the one action it is asking
 * for.
 *
 * The opener is the product's panel glyph rather than the three-line
 * hamburger it used to be. Two menus on one platform drawn differently is two
 * platforms as far as a thumb is concerned, and the product settled on this
 * mark; the marketing site had simply never been brought across.

                object with parts.

                No `--inset` modifier: an inset divider exists to clear a
                leading glyph column, and these rows have no leading glyph. The
                card's own inline padding is what holds the rules off the
                corners here, which is the same job done by the surface instead
                of by the row.
