/**
 * "STILL AVAILABLE", FOR ONE LISTING, FROM ITS HEALTH PAGE (C5's action).
 *
 * The same server action the weekly card on the agent home calls
 * (`confirmListingsAvailable`), which writes the lister's own confirmation
 * through `lister_confirm_available` and ignores any id that is not the
 * caller's live listing. Nothing here decides anything: the button sends,
 * and the page re-reads, so the availability row turns to "In place" only
 * once the database has the new date.
 *
 * The button morphs (loading ring, then the tick) because this is the one
 * deliberate action on the page; the result is said in words beneath it in
 * a polite live region, and a failure says nothing changed.
