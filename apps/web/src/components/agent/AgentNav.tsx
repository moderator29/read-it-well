 * `buildAgentNav` and `AgentNavList` used to live here. They moved to

 * ten 26px 3D BrandIcons in a column, which is the content family doing a
 * navigation's job, and a flat list of ten in which "List a property" sat at
 * the same level as "Settings".
 *
 * What is left here is what is genuinely Agent Mode's own: the mode pill and
