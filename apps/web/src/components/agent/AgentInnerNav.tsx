/**
 * THE AGENT DESK'S PAGES, ONE PULL AWAY (R3-08; D25; COMPONENT_LIBRARY "Glass
 * navigation": "the host and agent workspaces").
 *
 * The same second level the host desk has (`HostInnerNav`), drawn by
 * `AgentShell` above every agent page that is not an open conversation, so an
 * agent moves between the desk's queues (listings, inspections, bookings,
 * messages, reviews) and its money pages without walking back through the
 * dashboard or opening the drawer. It never replaces the rail, the drawer or
 * the dock (D28): it is the second level, and it carries the desk's queues
 * only, not the account rows the rail also holds.
 *
 * A thin client wrapper so the server shell passes plain words; the pull, the
 * spring, the haptic and the keyboard are `InnerNav`'s.
