/**
 * The code from the confirmation email.
 *
 * This screen is the half of sign-up that never existed. The email has always
 * carried a code as well as a link, under the words "Or enter this code", and
 * there was nowhere to enter it. Somebody who read the code rather than tapping
 * the link had no way forward at all.
 *
 * Typing the last digit submits. Not as a flourish: the code has a known
 * length, so waiting for somebody to reach for a button after they have
 * already given you everything you need is a step that exists for the form's
 * benefit and not for theirs. The button stays for a keyboard, for a paste that
 * lands short, and for anybody who does not trust a form that moves on its own.
 *
 * Pasting works from the code field alone rather than from one box per digit.
 * Separate boxes look considered and then fight every password manager, every
 * "copy" from a mail client that brings a trailing space, and every screen
 * reader, which reads them as a row of unlabelled inputs.
 *
 * HOW LONG THE CODE IS LIVES IN ONE PLACE, `lib/auth/confirmation-code`. This
 * file used to carry its own `const CODE_LENGTH = 6` and its own sentences
 * saying "six digits", and neither moved when the project began issuing eight.
