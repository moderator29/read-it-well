 * together, "Forgot password?" on the right, the pill, the "Or" rule, the

 * draws; the old second step, `/sign-in/email`, now forwards here. Nothing
 * about the door's safety moved with it: the same `signInWithEmail` action,
 * its two rate limits, its one neutral refusal, its `next` check.
 *
 * SIGN UP IS ONE SCREEN TOO (A1, 30 September; it was two steps). Only what
 * an account needs: first name and surname, the email, one password with
 * show and hide and its strength, and the two ticks the law and the store
 * require (the terms, and 18 or over), then Create account. Everything else
 * the old second step asked (nickname, where you stay and what you do, how
 * you heard of Vallo, a referral code) is asked after the account exists, on
 * the interests step of `/welcome`, or lives in Settings. The confirmation
 * password is gone: show and hide, and the reset flow, cover its typo.
 *
 * IT IS STILL ONE FORM POSTING ONE ACTION (`signUpWithEmail`); the server
 * checks everything again, including both ticks.
 *
 * Every word either mode draws comes out of the dictionary under `signUp` or
 * `auth`.
