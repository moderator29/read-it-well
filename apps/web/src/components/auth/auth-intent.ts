/**
 * What somebody was trying to do when we stopped them, as a URL.
 *
 * A signed-out visitor may READ all of RentMe: the listings, discovery, the
 * map, a property page. They may not DO anything. Every action gates, and the
 * gate has one job beyond asking them to sign in, which is the job that
 * everybody gets wrong: it must put them back where they were, doing what they
 * were doing. A save that becomes "welcome to your home screen" is a save that
 * did not happen and a person who has to start again.
 *
 * So the intent travels as two ordinary query parameters and nothing else. No
 * store, no cookie, no session-scoped draft:
 *
 *   /listing/abc?q=lekki                 the screen they were on
 *   /listing/abc?q=lekki&do=save         the same screen, plus the verb
 *   /sign-up?next=%2Flisting%2Fabc%3F... the door, carrying the whole thing
 *
 * A URL survives a full page load, an email confirmation round trip, a browser
 * restart and the back button, which is more than any of the alternatives can
 * say. It is also inspectable, which is why the surfaces that honour an intent
 * treat it as a HINT rather than as a command: `do=pay` reopens the payment
 * panel, it never charges anybody. Nothing here authorises anything.
 *
 * Pure and framework free so it can be tested directly, and so the server
 * routes and the client components read one implementation.
