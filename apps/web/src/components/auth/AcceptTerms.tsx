/**
 * The tick that turns a notice into an acceptance.
 *
 * WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE. "By continuing you agree to our Terms and Privacy
 * Policy", printed under the button. Nobody agreed to anything; they were
 * told, afterwards, that they had. There was no record of it, no version
 * against it, and the Community Rules did not exist to be agreed to.
 *
 * Apple's guideline 1.2 asks in its published text for four precautions and
 * says nothing about an agreement. The requirement for one, and for the words
 * about objectionable content, comes from the rejection message App Review
 * sends rather than from the guidelines page; that is recorded honestly in
 * `lib/legal/eula.tsx`. Either way, a marketplace where two strangers arrange
 * to meet at a property should be able to say what somebody agreed to and
 * when, so this is worth having on its own terms.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COMPONENT IS AND IS NOT. It is the control and the hidden version
 * field. It is NOT the enforcement: the form it sits in refuses to submit
 * until it is ticked, and the server writes the receipt.
 *
 * THE COMMENT HERE USED TO BE WRONG, AND IT WAS WRONG IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE
 * DIRECTION. It said `public.profiles.terms_accepted_at` was written by the
 * sign-up trigger when a version arrived with the metadata. Measured against
 * the live database on 22 September 2026: `public.profiles` has no
 * `terms_accepted_at` column and no `terms_version` column, and
 * `handle_new_user` does not mention terms at all. The hidden field below was
 * submitted, carried into the auth metadata, and dropped. NOBODY'S ACCEPTANCE
 * HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED, while three comments and a test said it had.
 *
 * It is recorded now, in `public.terms_acceptances`, written by the server
 * through `lib/legal/acceptance.ts` at the moment the account is created.
 */

/**
 * Re-exported so the tick box and its hidden field keep one import.
 *
 * The constant itself moved to `lib/legal/versions.ts` when the acceptance was
 * given a table: a version string that two files can each declare is a version
 * string that will eventually disagree with itself, and this one already had a
 * second declaration by the time it was looked for.
