/**
 * The moment after somebody taps the button in their email.
 *
 * This used to be nothing at all. `/auth/callback` was a route handler that
 * exchanged the code and answered with a 307, so the browser sat on a blank
 * white document for however long the round trip took and then jumped. On a
 * good connection that is a flicker. On a Nigerian mobile connection it is a
 * second or two of a page that appears to have failed, at the exact moment
 * somebody is deciding whether this platform works.
 *
 * So the screen exists, it says what is happening, and then it takes them in.
 *
 * It also does something the route handler could not. The implicit flow puts
 * the session in the URL FRAGMENT, and a fragment never leaves the browser: a
 * server literally cannot see it. Anybody arriving that way was told their link
 * had expired. Reading it needs code running in the page, which is what this
 * is.
 *
 * WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT this screen cannot finish, and it says so rather than
 * sitting on "Verifying" forever. Reading a fragment and writing a session both
 * need code running here. The `<noscript>` below sends those readers to the six
 * digit code instead, which is a plain form and needs nothing.

 * Holding it for a beat is what makes it a moment somebody remembers rather
 * than a frame they half saw. Two seconds is long enough to read the sentence
