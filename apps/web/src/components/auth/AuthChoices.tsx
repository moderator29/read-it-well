/**
 * The door, to the Slate references of 29 September
 * (`docs/design/references/2026-09-29`, 12 and 14).
 *
 * Under the curved top block (drawn by the auth layout): the big title, the
 * labelled email card, the Continue pill, the "Or" rule, the round Google and
 * Apple doors, and the line to the other door. The pieces are the shared
 * Slate system in `./slate.tsx`.
 *
 * SIGN-UP'S DOOR ONLY SINCE B-1 (29 September). `/sign-in` is one screen now
 * (`EmailAuthForm`, email and password together, refs 12 and 14), so this
 * chooser serves `/sign-up`; its sign-in mode is kept for any caller that
 * still asks for it and posts to `continueWithEmail`, which sends a sign-in
 * back to `/sign-in` with the address filled in.
 *
 * EMAIL FIRST, AND THE FIELD IS REAL. The render puts the address on the
 * first screen and the password on the next, which is the flow this platform
 * already runs: the chooser here, the form at `/sign-in/email`. So the field
 * is a form that posts the address to `continueWithEmail`, which holds it in
 * a short-lived httpOnly cookie (never the URL, where it would sit in history
 * and referrers) and redirects to the email screen, which opens with it
 * filled in and the cursor on the password. The
 * browser's back button still undoes the step, because it is still a route
 * and not an in-place expansion.
 *
 * GOOGLE IS DRAWN ONLY WHEN IT WORKS. `getProviderStates` says whether the
 * dashboard has the provider on; a door that can only fail is the same defect
 * as a Reserve button on a listing nobody can book, so with Google off the
 * rule and the round button are simply not there and email is the way in. The
 * door posts to the real `startGoogleOAuth` action with the destination and
 * the intent, exactly as the callback expects them (`SocialDoors`).
 *
 * A server component: every control is a link or a form posting to a server
 * action, so none of it needs to be shipped as JavaScript.
