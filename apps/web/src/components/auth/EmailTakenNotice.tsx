/**
 * Saying "that address is already signed up" while there is still time to act
 * on it.
 *
 * The old shape asked for an address, a password, a name, a state, a local
 * government and an occupation, and only then, on submit, found out. The first
 * real sign-up on this platform hit exactly that: an account had been made with
 * Google an hour earlier, the same address went into the email form, and
 * Supabase answered 200 while sending nothing at all.
 *
 * The check runs on BLUR rather than on every keystroke. An address is not
 * valid until somebody has finished typing it, so checking as they type asks
 * the same question thirty times and answers it wrongly twenty-nine of them.
 *
 * WHICH METHOD, not just whether. "You already have an account" leaves
 * somebody exactly where they were. "Use Continue with Google, that is how you
 * made it" is the whole answer, and it is the difference between getting in
 * and resetting a password that was never set.
 *
 * A refusal or a rate limit answers "unknown", which shows nothing. This
 * notice can only ever add information; it never blocks the form, and somebody
 * who ignores it still gets the honest refusal on submit.
