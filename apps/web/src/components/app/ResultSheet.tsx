/**
 * One confirmation, for every flow.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT REPLACES, AND WHY THERE WERE NINE OF THEM.
 *
 * Every flow on this platform wrote its own moment. Nine bespoke confirmation
 * screens, each choosing its own mark, its own variant and its own copy, and
 * they disagreed: `MomentVariant` was `success | brand | warning` with no
 * failure at all, so EIGHT failure surfaces were painted
 * `--nf-state-warning`, which resolves to `--nf-cyan-400`, which is the exact
 * token `--nf-status-pending` is defined as. A crash, a cancelled booking and
 * a declined payment were drawn in the colour this product reserves for "we
 * are still working on it". Two of them used `calendar-check`, a TICK, to say
 * "This booking was cancelled" and "We could not find that booking".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY A SHEET AND NOT A SCREEN.
 *
 * `MomentScreen` renders inline in the document flow at `min-height: 60vh`
 * with `justify-content: center`. On checkout that puts the confirmation for a
 * payment BELOW the booking summary, so a person who has just paid 1.2m naira
 * scrolls to find out whether it worked. A moment you scroll to is not a
 * moment. A confirmation arrives over the top of what you were doing, and the
 * thing you were doing is still there underneath when it leaves.
 *
 * `components/ui/Sheet.tsx` already owns the portal, the spring, the detents,
 * the drag, the focus trap, the counted scroll lock, Escape, focus
 * restoration, the safe-area inset and the reduced-motion branch. This
 * composes it and writes none of that again.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ONE RULE THE TYPE SYSTEM ENFORCES.
 *
 * `consequence` is REQUIRED on `pending`, `review` and `failed` and optional
 * everywhere else, through a discriminated union rather than a comment. It is
 * the line that removes fear - "this usually takes a few seconds; if it takes
 * longer, your money has not moved" - and it is the line every product skips.
 * A call site cannot ship a pending sheet with no horizon, which is the same
 * trick `KycStatus` already uses to make a reason mandatory on a rejection.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
 *
 * No confetti, no counting numbers, no staggered lines. A confirmation's job
 * is to be screenshotted and sent to a landlord, an agent or a bank, and a
 * number mid-count cannot be. The mark lands, the glow fades in behind it, and
 * nothing else moves.

          mode was removed from the platform on 23 September 2026, so the only
          ground this glow can land on is the one it was drawn for, and a

          weight in the class string.

          rule. Rose at 26 per cent, blurred, over navy composites to a
          MAGENTA bloom, and magenta is one of the hues this brand has banned by
          name; rendered at 390px in the dark it was the most saturated thing on
          the screen and it was not blue. The second is restraint: the glow
          belongs to the primary action, to focus and to the active state, so a
          destructive or failed surface gets its colour and its weight and no
          bloom. `expired` is left unlit for the same reason in reverse: a
          window closing is the quietest thing this component says.

 * there underneath: a payment against a booking, a transfer against a wallet.
 * It arrives over the page and leaves it behind.
 *
 * These are not that. An error boundary, a booking that cannot be found and a
 * cancelled booking are the whole state of the route: there is nothing
 * underneath for a sheet to sit over, and a dismissable sheet over an empty
 * page leaves somebody looking at nothing. So they render in the flow, with
 * the same mark, the same verdict, the same consequence and the same two
 * actions as the sheet, in the same seven-state vocabulary.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EIGHT SURFACES WERE PAINTED IN THE PENDING COLOUR AND THIS IS WHAT THEY
 * BECOME.
 *
 * `MomentVariant` was `success | brand | warning`. There was no failure
 * variant at all, so every failure took `warning`, `.nf-moment--warning` sets
 * `--nf-moment-color: var(--nf-state-warning)`, `--nf-state-warning` is
 * defined as `var(--nf-cyan-400)`, and `--nf-status-pending` is defined as
 * `var(--nf-state-warning)`. They are not two tokens that happen to be
 * similar. They are the same value under two names, so a crash, a cancelled
 * booking and a booking that does not exist were all drawn in the colour this
 * product reserves for "still going through".
 *
 * Two of them went further and used `calendar-check`, a calendar with a TICK,
 * as the mark for "This booking was cancelled" and "We could not find that
 * booking": a success mark borrowed because it was the closest thing
 * available, saying the opposite of the sentence beside it.
