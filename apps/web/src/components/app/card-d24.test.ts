/**
 * D24 ON EVERY DISCOVERY CARD (the founder, 6 October 2026), GUARDED BY SOURCE.
 *
 * The instruction has two halves and this file holds both, for every surface
 * W2 owns that draws a listing as a card:
 *
 *   1. THE VISIBLE EXAMPLE LABEL IS OFF. No `nf-badge--example`, no
 *      `ExampleNotice`, no "Example" word read from the dictionary. The
 *      listings stay; the founder removes the rows at launch.
 *   2. NOTHING UNEARNED IS ON. Where a card draws the Verified mark or a
 *      rating, the same expression withholds it from an example (`isDemo`),
 *      so a mapper regression can never print a tick on an invented flat.
 *      The danger the directive names was never the missing word; it was
 *      fabricated trust.
 *
 * Read with comments stripped, so a comment explaining the rule can never be
 * what satisfies it.
