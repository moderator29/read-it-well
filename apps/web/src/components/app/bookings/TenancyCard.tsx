/**
 * A TENANCY CHARGE ON THE BOOKINGS SCREEN, AND IT IS NOT A STAY.
 *
 * `getMyBookings` used to build a list of the rent booking ids and then drop
 * exactly those rows, so a tenant who had opened a rent payment saw NOTHING on
 * /bookings: not a wrong row, no row at all, and no route back to the one page
 * that takes the money. The read has a fourth group now (`BookingGroups.rent`,
 * `RentChargeView`) and this is what draws it.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, because a tenancy is not a stay: no nights, no
 * guest count, no date range, no check-in and no check-out. The
 * yearly-rent-with-nightly-pickers error is on the build's stop list and it is
 * at its most believable in a list, where a year's rent beside the word
 * "nights" reads as a price somebody could pay tonight. A tenancy has ONE day,
 * the day the keys change hands, and a period word the rent module itself owns
 * ("Yearly").
 *
 * THE FIGURE IS THE CHARGE'S FROZEN TOTAL, already through `formatMoney` in
 * the read, so a lister editing a fee after the tenant opened the payment
 * cannot move the number under them, and this card quotes what `/rent/pay`
 * will take.
 *
 * THE CONTROL IS DRAWN ONLY WHEN IT CAN ACT. `payable` is the read's own word
 * for "the tenant can still complete this", and it is false the moment money
 * has settled or the charge is no longer PENDING. A settled tenancy is a
 * record with no payment control on it; the rent page's own honest states
 * answer everything else, so nothing here offers a door that would turn
 * somebody away.
