/**
 * CANCELLING A STAY. ONE DEFINITION, BOTH SURFACES.
 *
 * This was a private function inside `app/(app)/bookings/MyBookings.tsx`, which
 * was fine while `/bookings` was the only screen that listed a stay. `/trips`
 * is the Stays side's diary of the same stays, and when it moved to the date
 * spine it had no way to call one off: a guest looking at their own booking on
 * the side of the product that owns stays could see it and not cancel it.
 *
 * The rule the platform applies to this is that a capability is never lost to
 * gain a layout, and the rule this file exists for is that there is exactly ONE
 * cancel flow. Two copies of a confirm-then-write sheet is how one of them ends
 * up with a fix the other never gets, on the control that releases somebody's
 * dates and their money.
 *
 * `<Sheet>` owns the portal, the drag handle, the detents, the focus trap,
 * focus restoration, Escape, the backdrop and the body scroll lock. What is
 * left here is the decision: the server action, the refusal, and the success
 * state. On success the router refreshes and the server-rendered list becomes
 * the single source of truth, never optimistic guesswork.
