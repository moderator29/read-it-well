/**
 * "More like this" / "Not for me", on the card itself.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT ONLY IN SETTINGS.
 *
 * `/settings/interests` already asks the same question, and it is a backstop: a
 * screen somebody has to go looking for. Every product of this shape gets its
 * real signal from a control that is in front of a person at the moment they
 * have an opinion, and the whole cost of that opinion is one tap on the card
 * they are already looking at. So this writes THE SAME stored answer that
 * screen writes - `profiles.interests`, a `property_type[]` - through
 * `adjustInterest`. One signal, one vocabulary, no shadow table.
 *
 * SIGNED OUT, IT IS NOT RENDERED. The search page decides that, because only
 * the server knows. There is no anonymous store for this and inventing one
 * (a cookie, localStorage) would create a second answer that has to be merged
 * with the real one at sign-in by a rule nobody has written. A control that
 * appears and then says "sign in to continue" is worse than no control: it
 * spends somebody's tap to tell them they wasted it.
 *
 * DISCOVERABILITY. A small square control on the card, visible at rest rather
 * than on hover, because a phone has no hover and a long-press is not an
 * affordance anybody can see. It paints at 32px and reaches the 44pt floor
 * through an `::after` that overflows its box - never a child span, which
 * `icons-and-targets.spec` cannot measure and which therefore reports as a
 * failure even when the target is genuinely met. See the note in `Switch.tsx`.
 *
 * WHY A SHEET RATHER THAN TWO BUTTONS ON THE CARD. Two visible verbs on every
 * card in a scrolling grid is twenty visible verbs, and it turns a results page
 * into a survey. The sheet also has room to say what the control actually does,
 * which matters: somebody who thinks "Not for me" hides the listing will be
 * angry when it is still there. `Sheet` renders nothing at all until it opens,
 * so a grid of twenty cards carries twenty buttons and zero dialogs.
 *
 * HONEST FEEDBACK, WHICH IS THE POINT.
 *
 * The optimistic state flips the moment the tap lands and REVERTS if the write
 * fails, and the failure shows the action's own message rather than a shrug.
 * The confirmation names the market and what happened to it, and the two
 * "already" lines exist because the write is idempotent: "More like this" on a
 * market already stored changes nothing, and the screen says so. A toast
 * reading "Saved" over a write that never happened is the exact dishonesty this
 * component is built to avoid, and the server is what decides which line is
 * true - `changed` comes back from the action, not from a guess made here.
