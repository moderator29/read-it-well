/**
 * WHETHER A MEMBER HAS MET A FEATURE'S FIRST RUN, AND THE ONE GATE THAT ASKS.
 *
 * Who owns what (cross-session contract, section 2, "Feature onboarding"):
 * Session 3 owns the system and the screens; Session 2 owns the server-side
 * seen-state that survives a device change. That state does not exist yet,
 * so this file builds against an interface and marks the stub plainly.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * STUB, PENDING SESSION 2 REQUEST W7-R1 (the member's seen-state) AND W7-R2
 * (the write). `serverFirstRunStore` below answers "unknown" for every
 * feature and records nothing. When W7-R1 lands, its two methods call the
 * read and the write Session 2 provides, and nothing else in this folder
 * changes: the gate already prefers a server answer over the device's.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * FAILING SAFE, which is the whole design of the stub. While the server cannot
 * answer, the device's cookie decides (`first-run-device.ts`), so the rule in
 * force is "at most once per device". Every failure points the same way, at
 * NOT showing: an unknown answer with no cookie shows the first run once and
 * the first run records itself as it opens; a read that throws shows nothing;
 * the passed flag on the address shows nothing. A first run that fails to
 * appear costs a member nothing. One that appears twice, or traps them, is
 * the product nagging, and is the failure this file exists to rule out.
