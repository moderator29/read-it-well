/**
 * The property card, to the results image (3EB3E2A9).

 * The photograph carries the marks: Verified top-left, the heart top-right,
 * the market tag on the photo's foot. The body carries the words in the
 * order a person compares them: title, where, the figure, the facts.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT. A listing with `listing_photos` rows shows
 * its own photograph. One without shows the scene photograph for its kind
 * through `MediaFrame` (the manifest wires whatever is on disk) and says
 * "No photographs yet" on the frame, so a category plate is never mistaken
 * for a picture of this property. The Verified pill appears only on a row a
