/**
 * THE BUTTON BESIDE THE PHONE GATE'S REFUSAL (founder's FULL GATE ruling,
 * 13 October 2026).
 *
 * Every gated action (a first message, visit, booking, payment or listing,
 * and the first review and report) answers a member with no confirmed phone
 * with the `required` sentence and `gate: "phone"` (`lib/phone-otp/gate.ts`).
 * The screen keeps drawing the sentence where it always drew its error, and
 * puts this beside it: one button to Settings, Phone, carrying where the
 * member is now as `next`, so the confirm form sends them straight back
 * (`/settings/phone`, `PhoneConfirmForm`). `withNext` drops a `next` that is
 * not a same-site path, so this can never become an open redirect.
 *
 * Renders nothing unless `show`: pass `isPhoneGate(result)`.
