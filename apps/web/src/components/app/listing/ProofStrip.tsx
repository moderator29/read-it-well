/**
 * THE PROOF STRIP (V-03): dated facts, on the card and the page, in one place.
 *
 * `docs/PRODUCT.md` section 6 says it in a sentence: "Inspected 12 July 2026
 * is a fact a reader can weigh; a tick is a promise." The columns that hold
 * those facts existed and reached no renter. This is where they reach one.
 *
 * WHAT IT DRAWS IS DECIDED ELSEWHERE. `lib/trust/proof-strip.ts` returns the
 * lines, in a fixed order, and only lines whose timestamp the database holds.
 * This component never adds one and never draws a placeholder: given no
 * lines it renders NOTHING, not an empty panel and not a "nothing checked
 * yet". A missing check is not a sentence the claims rule allows.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES.
 *
 *   compact  On a card, two lines at most, and NOT interactive. The card is
 *            one link to the listing, a link may not contain a button, and a
 *            tap on the card lands on the page where every line opens its
 *            sheet. So the compact lines are text, and the page is where they
 *            are explained.
 *
 *   full     On the listing page, every line, each a button that opens a
 *            sheet saying what the check is and, as prominently, what it is
 *            NOT ("We are not a land registry"). A trust claim that lists only
 *            what it covers is how a checked identity gets read as a checked
 *            building.
 *
 * Colour is never the signal: every line carries its icon and its words, and
 * the icon is decoration beside a sentence that stands on its own.
