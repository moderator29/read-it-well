/**
 * THE CODE A PERSON READS OUT OVER THE PHONE.
 *
 * `VL-` plus six characters, minted by the database the moment a listing goes
 * live. GOVERNING-12 screen four draws it as the thing a searcher typed, and
 * GOVERNING-08 screen four draws it as a panel on the SENT FOR REVIEW screen.
 *
 * ONLY THE FIRST OF THOSE SHIPS, AND THE SECOND IS NOT HERE WAITING FOR A
 * CALLER. The panel was written and then deleted rather than left in the tree,
 * because the render draws it at a moment when the code does not exist: a code
 * is a public handle and a listing in review has no public existence. There is
 * no surface in this product today where a lister meets their code at the
 * scale that panel draws it, and the closest honest one, a "your listing is
 * live" screen, has not been built. An exported component nothing imports is
 * exactly the defect Track N exists to close, and adding a sixth to the list
 * while fixing five of them would have been absurd.
 *
 * ONE MORE THING TRANSLATED RATHER THAN COPIED, recorded rather than quietly
 * changed: the render prints `VL-7K4M-92`, which is eight body characters
 * with an inner hyphen. Ours is six characters and one hyphen, because the
 * brief fixes the format and a render is not a specification.
 *
 * What the wizard does instead of drawing an empty panel is say, in words,
 * that the code arrives when the listing goes live. That is the honest
 * version of the same promise.
 *
 * The copy control is `Button`, which is a rounded rectangle on
 * `--nf-radius-control` and has no capsule variant, so the shape law holds
 * here by construction rather than by inspection.
