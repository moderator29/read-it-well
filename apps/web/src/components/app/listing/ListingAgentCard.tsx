/**
 * The agent card of 9E8B56ED, with what the product can honestly say.
 *
 * The render shows a named agent with a star rating and a review count. The
 * listing read carries no rating for a lister, so that is not invented: the
 * "Verified agent" pill appears only when a person checked them, and the
 * control is the real one, the conversation. A phone number is never printed;
 * the conversation is where the platform protects both sides.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE HEADING USED TO CONTRADICT THE LINE UNDER IT, ON EVERY OWNER LISTING
 *
 * The name fallback was `t.catalogue.detail.agentRole`, the words "Agent on
 * Vallo", printed for EVERY listing whatever its `listing_role`. On an owner's
 * listing that put "Agent on Vallo" directly above "Listed by the owner". One
 * of those two sentences is false on every owner listing, and it was the one
 * drawn in the heavier weight at the top of the card.
 *
 * So the fallback now MATCHES THE ROLE, and where a role has no honest noun it
 * prints nothing rather than a wrong one:
 *
 *   agent   "Agent on Vallo", which is exactly what that listing is.
 *   owner   NOTHING. There is no honest noun that is not simply a repeat of
 *           "Listed by the owner" on the line below, and the owner sentence
 *           names nobody on purpose: the offer IS that there is no
 *           intermediary.
 *   firm    NOTHING. We know it is a firm and not WHICH firm, "Agent on Vallo"
 *           is false, and a generic "registered firm" would borrow a
 *           trust word for a claim no member of staff has checked yet.
 *           `listing_role` stays a claim until `ownership_verified_at` or
 *           `mandate_verified_at` is dated beside it.
 *
 * AND WHEN THE ROLE IS ABSENT THE CARD DRAWS EXACTLY WHAT IT DREW BEFORE. A
 * listing with no `listingRole` is the seed catalogue or an external shape,
 * which is the pre Track G state; changing that would be a regression dressed
 * as a fix, on surfaces this change was never about.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A NAME IS NOT A CHECK
 *
 * When `name` is present it is the heading, and it comes from
 * `public.listing_lister`, which publishes a display name and nothing else. It
 * says WHO, never whether anybody verified them. The badge beside it is the
 * only thing on this card that means a person here looked at a document.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "LISTED BY", THE FOUNDER'S REFERENCE (13 October 2026)
 *
 * Given `lister` (the page's `readListerCard`), the card is the reference's
 * row: the photograph, the name with the published badge beside it
 * (`TierBadge`, from `person_badge`, never a guess), one role word under it
 * (Landlord, Agent or Agency), and two round monochrome buttons on the right,
 * call and message, on the solid plate: ink by day, paper at night. The person
 * is a link to their profile when they have claimed a handle.
 *
 * The name on this row is the lister's PUBLIC profile name, the same one their
 * `/u/<handle>` page already shows anybody, and the founder asked for it on the
 * owner's listing too ("Listed by" with the owner's name and Landlord). A firm
 * is drawn as the firm (see `lister-card.ts`).
 *
 *   Message   the listing's own conversation (`/messages/new?listing=`),
 *             gated to sign in like every other action a guest may see. Not
 *             governed by `contact_policy`, which is the profile's door only
 *             (`lib/social/message-door.ts`), exactly as before.
 *   Call      `call` when the page could place one (the `video_calls` switch,
 *             a signed-in reader and a thread that exists); otherwise the same
 *             conversation, labelled for what it is: message them first to
 *             arrange a call. A phone number is never printed.
 *
 * No "Online" dot and no rating: there is no presence signal and no person
 * rating behind either, so neither is drawn.
