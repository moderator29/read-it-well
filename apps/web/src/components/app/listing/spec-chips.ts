 * THE FACT CHIPS UNDER THE TITLE (founder's reference, 13 October 2026).
 *
 * Beds, baths and size first, because those are the three a renter reads
 * before anything else, then what the place carries: parking, backup power,
 * guests on a stay, toilets, furnishing, the floor and the build. Each chip is
 * a column the lister filled in; a column nobody filled is not drawn, so the
 * row is exactly as long as the truth and never pads itself with a zero.
 *
 * PURE AND IN ITS OWN FILE so it can be proved under the unit config, which
 * cannot import a `.tsx` file (see `lister-role.ts` for why), and so the
 * server page can build the chips while the row that draws them is a client
 * component with a "+N" toggle.
