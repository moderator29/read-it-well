/**
 * Light, water, and getting through the gate.
 *
 * The three questions a Nigerian renter asks before the price, and the reason
 * nobody else can answer them: they are structured columns here, not a tick box
 * called "Backup Power" that flattens Band A and a generator running seven to
 * eleven into the same claim.
 *
 * Unanswered is rendered as unanswered. A host who has not said whether there
 * is light must not have silence read as a yes, so the row says so plainly and
 * points at the one control that gets a real answer: the thread with the agent.
 *
 * The gate block has three states and they are all designed. Before a booking
 * is confirmed the guest is told the details exist and when they arrive. After
 * confirmation the real details are here, read through the caller's own
 * policies. A listing with no gate at all omits the block, because a panel
 * explaining the absence of a gate is noise.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SURFACE CHANGED, THE FACTS DID NOT.
 *
 * This was an `.nf-card` carrying its own `h2`, sitting inside the detail
 * page's glass content sheet: a bordered box inside a bordered box, which is
 * the nesting the whole rebuild exists to remove. It is now a run of hairline
 * rows on the GROUND, with the heading supplied by the page's `Section` so
 * there is exactly one heading treatment for every section of the screen.
 *
 * Objects went from 40px to 56px and the values from 0.9375rem to 1rem, on the
 * shared scale in `Screen.tsx`. No object here sits on a tile, a chip or a
 * ring: the mark sits on the surface with its label beside it.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ROWS ARE MARKED WITH THE REAL THING (Session 3, Stage 5; D29 Tier A).
 *
 * A generator, an inverter and its battery, a prepaid meter, a water tank and
 * a borehole pump are things a Nigerian renter has stood beside, so the row
 * that states one is marked with that object, realistic, at 40px, rather than
 * with a line glyph standing in for it. An object is drawn only for what the
 * agent STATED: a row nobody answered keeps the quiet line glyph, because an
 * object beside "not answered" would picture a thing nobody claimed. The
 * prepaid meter, which used to hang under the light as a sentence led by a
 * tick, is its own row with its own object: a tick is a promise, and this is
 * a fact about how the light is paid for.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
