/**
 * The listing's pinned action bar.
 *
 * This was a floating `nf-card` that sat in the document flow with
 * `sticky bottom-…` and `lg:hidden`, which produced two failures the audit
 * calls P0. It read as a card hovering over the page rather than as the
 * blurred footer every reference screen ends with, and from `lg` up it was not
 * rendered at all, so the widest viewport - the one a listing gets shared to on
 * a desktop - had no call to action anywhere on the screen.
 *
 * It is now the `ActionBar` primitive, which the audit found shipped and used
 * zero times. That primitive owns the three things this file kept getting
 * wrong: the blur (so the content reads as passing beneath the bar rather than
 * stopping at a seam), the home-indicator inset, and the stacking level. This
 * file is left with what is genuinely local: what the bar quotes, and which
 * actions the market allows.
 *
 * Reference 3 ends on a PAIR - a hairline ghost pill beside the solid one - and
 * so does this, where a second action honestly exists. A stay pairs Message
 * agent with Check availability; a partner restaurant pairs its menu with
 * directions. A rental has exactly one path (message the agent, inspect, then
 * pay) so it carries one full-strength button and no invented companion.
 *
 * What it quotes is never a guess: once real dates are picked it shows the very
 * total the reserve panel is about to submit, in integer kobo through
 * `formatMoney`, beside the nights it covers. Until then it shows the listing's
 * own rate and what that rate buys.

/**
 * `external` STOOD HERE AND IT IS DELETED.
 *
 * It read "Off-platform destinations open in a new tab" and it spread
 * `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` onto both buttons in this bar.
 * NOT ONE CALL SITE EVER SET IT. Its whole purpose was to take a person off
 * Vallo, and the two features that would have reached for it first, a partner
 * handoff and a restaurant's own menu link, are exactly the two the platform
 * has now decided are ingested rather than linked.
 *
 * A prop whose only reason to exist is a rule violation does not sit in the
 * tree waiting for somebody to use it. Anything genuinely off-platform that
 * ever belongs on this bar goes through the consented interstitial, not
 * through a spread on a button.
