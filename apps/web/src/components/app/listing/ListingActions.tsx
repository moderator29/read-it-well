/**
 * The two controls that float over the gallery: share and save.
 *
 * They sit on photography rather than on the page canvas, so they are painted
 * as dark glass with white marks in both themes deliberately: a paper-white
 * control would vanish on a bright photo, and a night-only glass panel would
 * look wrong in daylight. Everything underneath them is an image, so this is
 * the one place where the same treatment is correct at noon and at midnight.
 *
 * That reasoning was right and the implementation was not: it was written as
 * bg-black/45, border-white/25 and text-white, by hand, in this file and in
 * five others, so nothing recorded WHY the darkness was deliberate and nothing
 * distinguished it from the dark-only literals that genuinely do break in
 * daylight. It now reads the `-on-media` token family, which is theme
 * independent on purpose and says so in one place.
 *
 * Save flips instantly and settles against the truth the action returns:
 * a catalogue listing is kept on the device, a platform listing is a row under
 * RLS, and a write that fails puts the heart straight back and says why.
 *
 * THE HEART ON A STAY AND ON A RESTAURANT WROTE NOTHING, which is worse than
 * having no heart at all. `/stay/<id>` carries an ACCOMMODATION id and the
 * venue face carries a BUSINESS id; `saved_items.listing_id` has a foreign key
 * to `public.listings`, so both taps came back as "this place is no longer
 * available, so it cannot be saved" against a place that was right there on the
 * screen. Their shortlist is `saved_places`, and `place` is how this control is
 * told which shelf it is writing to. Absent, it is a listing and nothing about
 * the old path changes.
 *
 * SHARE ASKS WHICH SHARE IT IS, and it used to have only one answer. It called
 * the browser's own sheet and fell back to the clipboard, which sends a place
 * to somebody who is NOT on Vallo. The founder's complaint was that he could
 * not send a property into somebody's DMs, and every part of that path already
 * existed apart from the way in: `/messages/share/<kind>/<id>` lists his own
 * conversations under RLS and sends a real message that the thread expands
 * into a card. `ShareSheet` is the way in, and the link is still the second
 * row on it, so the control is never a dead end either way.
