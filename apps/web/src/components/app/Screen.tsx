/**
 * THE SCREEN LANGUAGE.
 *
 * One vocabulary for every screen a signed-in person uses. Not a utility bag:
 * a set of decisions taken once, here, so that twenty screens read as one
 * product instead of twenty.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * An audit of the signed-in screens found the same four jobs solved four ways
 * each. Three distinct empty states, at three object sizes (64, 80, 96), two of
 * them wrapped in a card so that a message whose entire job is to say "there is
 * nothing here" arrived inside a bordered box. Four section-heading treatments.
 * Section gaps from 1.25rem to 2rem with no rule behind which was which. Body
 * copy at 0.875rem and labels at 0.75rem across the whole product.
 *
 * Nothing was wrong on its own screen. Together they were the thing the owner
 * kept describing: choked, jam-packed, twenty pages by twenty people.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SURFACE LANGUAGE. Four surfaces, and only four.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The instruction was not "fewer boxes". It was a better container language:
 * decide what a surface MEANS, then apply it identically everywhere.
 *
 *   GROUND    The page. The default, and the right answer most of the time.
 *             Sections of a screen live here. They are grouped by a heading,
 *             by space and by alignment, never by a border. `Section`.
 *
 *   RAISED    `.nf-card`. Reserved for a discrete OBJECT: a thing you could
 *             pick up and move somewhere else and it would still make sense.
 *             A listing card in a grid. A booking panel. A preview floating
 *             over a map. A section of a page is not an object, so a section
 *             is not raised.
 *
 *   INSET     A run of like things, separated by hairlines. `RowList`. This is
 *             the replacement for a stack of cards: eight cards are eight
 *             borders, eight radii and eight shadows; eight rows are seven
 *             lines. The reference platform uses this everywhere and so do we.
 *
 *   OVERLAY   `Sheet`, `ActionBar`. Temporary depth, above everything, for
 *             what is secondary in the layout but not secondary in importance.
 *
 * THE ONE HARD RULE: A RAISED SURFACE MAY NOT CONTAIN ANOTHER RAISED SURFACE.
 * Maximum nesting depth is one. If something inside a card wants a card, it
 * wants a `RowList` or a `Section`, or it wants to be behind a `Disclosure`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTHING IS DELETED
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Every capability stays reachable. When a screen is overloaded the answer is
 * hierarchy, grouping and progressive disclosure, never removal. That is what
 * `Disclosure` is for: it moves a secondary block one tap away into a sheet and
 * keeps it in the product. Losing function to gain calm would be a failure.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LINES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A line is drawn where two things genuinely need separating, and nowhere else.
 * Between rows of a list: yes. Above a section that begins a new subject: yes.
 * Around a group that a heading already groups: no.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * COLOUR
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Layer-2 semantic tokens only (ADR-002), so every surface here follows the
 * theme. Dark is the default and must feel calm; light is a true light theme,
 * not an inversion. Nothing in this file names a colour.

 *
 * ONE CONTAINER PER GROUP, NOT ONE PER ITEM. This is the whole idea and it is
 * most of why the reference platform's screens feel calm: their settings screen
 * puts account information, profile switching, payments and history inside a
 * SINGLE rounded surface separated by hairlines, where we would have drawn four
 * cards. Two or three surfaces per screen against our eight or nine. If you are
 * about to render two of these next to each other, they are almost certainly
 * one of these with a `RowList` inside it.
 *
 * BIG RADIUS, BIG PADDING. `--nf-radius-xl` (22px) and `p-6 sm:p-8`, against
 * the `p-4`/`p-5` and medium radius that was everywhere. A surface should feel
 * roomy. If it feels tight it is holding too much, not padded too little.
 *
 * NO SECOND BORDER. The glass already reads as a LIFT off the canvas through
 * its rim and its elevation, so nothing here adds a visible outline on top of
 * that. An outlined box and a lifted surface are two different container
 * languages and drawing both at once is what makes a card look heavy.
 *
 * THE LABEL GOES OUTSIDE. A heading inside the surface costs a line of padding
 * and makes the surface look busier than it is. `Section` puts the title above,
 * small and quiet, and the surface holds only content. That pairing - label
 * outside, content inside - is the standard composition.
 *
 * NOTHING NESTED. Inside one of these you find rows, text and controls. You do
 * not find another one. That is the one hard rule of the surface language and
 * it has no exceptions.
