/**
 * THE ONE FORK POINT IN A THREAD.

 * Rendered between the header and the scroll column. Everything else in
 * `ThreadView` (bubbles, composer, optimistic send, realtime, attachments,
 * the safety line) is shared by every kind of conversation; this slot is the
 * only place the kind of thing the chat is FOR changes what is drawn.
 *
 * Three faces, three files, and the separation is structural rather than a
 * flag: a reservation thread cannot grow an inspection button because
 * `ReservationFace` never imports one. All three now wear one material, the
 * context card of 9E06F51C: a glass object with the mark on the left, the
 * enquiry named, the property under it, and the face's own controls in a row.
 *
 * A listing thread always draws the context card (the rental enquiry, the
 * property, a chevron to it); the inspection face sits under it only when
 * there is a live inspection to answer.

          THE WAY TO THE THING THE CONVERSATION IS ABOUT.

          This branch returned the face alone and the face carries no link, no
          button and no href, so a guest in a table thread could not reach the
          restaurant or their own trips from the one screen they were on. The
          card is the listing branch's, with its actions row rather than a
          chevron, because two destinations cannot both be a card-wide anchor
          and an anchor inside an anchor is not markup.

          The restaurant link is drawn only when the reservation carries a
          listing: a table held against a business row has nowhere on the
          catalogue to point at, and a dead control is never drawn.

          Same repair as the reservation branch, and the governing chat image
          asks for exactly this pair: "View booking details" as the primary and
          a second, quieter way to the place. `/bookings/<id>` is the trips
          hub's own detail route, which is where the booking itself lives.

          THE PROPERTY LINK GOES TO THE CATALOGUE PAGE. `loadThread` gives this
          face a `listingId` and no accommodation id, so `/stay/<id>` would be
          a guess; `/listing/<listingId>` is the row the booking was written
          against and always resolves. Carrying the accommodation id through
          would be a change to `lib/messages/live.ts`, which is another
          worker's file.
