/**
 * The side navigation, as data.
 *
 * One module, read by both the desktop rail and the phone drawer, so the two
 * cannot drift.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS FILE JUST GOT MUCH SHORTER, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
 *
 * An ordinary renter was offered TWENTY-FIVE destinations here, and an agent
 * who is also staff was offered FORTY. Nobody navigates twenty-five things.
 * They scan the first five, give up, and use search. Counted before:
 *
 *   Discover      Home, Rent, Explore + 5 children, Feed + 3 children   12
 *   Account       Bookings, Messages, Notifications, Wallet, Assistant,
 *                 Profile + 3 children                                   9
 *   Become agent                                                         1
 *   Legal         Help, Terms, Privacy                                   3
 *                                                                       ==
 *                                                                       25
 *
 * Counted after: ELEVEN for a renter and TWELVE for an agent who is also staff
 * (the same eleven, minus the Become an agent row nobody needs now, plus one
 * row each for the two workspaces). Every one of them is a place that does
 * something the others do not.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SUB-NAVIGATION LEFT ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE. No row has children,
 * `NavTree` no longer renders them, and the rule that produced that is the
 * owner's: if a thing needs children it is either its own screen or it does not
 * belong in navigation. What went, and why:
 *
 *  - **The five Explore children.** `/search?type=hotel`, `?type=property`,
 *    `?type=home`, `?type=restaurant`, `?type=experience` were five rows
 *    pointing at ONE screen with one query parameter changed. The category is
 *    a control on that screen, at the top of the filter drawer, offering every
 *    market the catalogue actually holds rather than five of them. Five rows in
 *    a drawer were a worse copy of a filter.
 *
 *  - **Rent.** `/rent` was discovery filtered to the long-let market, which is
 *    the same thing again: a filter presented as a destination. The page is
 *    deleted now (V-26) and the address redirects to `/search?market=rent`.
 *
 *  - **The three Feed children.** Feed, Places and People are the feed screen
 *    and two indexes reachable from it. The first child pointed at the same
 *    href as its own parent.
 *
 *  - **The three Profile children.** Profile is already a row of its own at the
 *    top of the rail (`nf-nav__who`) and the island on the tab bar. Saved is
 *    promoted to a real row because it is a destination people go to on
 *    purpose; Settings likewise.
 *
 *  - **The whole Legal section.** Help, Terms and Privacy are all three
 *    already rows inside Settings, under About, and they were only ever put
 *    here because nothing else in the product linked them. Something does now.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: nothing here is offered to somebody who cannot use it.
 * The agent workspace appears only for an approved agent and the console only
 * for staff, both resolved from the person's own RLS-bound reads in
 * `getShellIdentity`.
 *
 * WHERE THE ASSISTANT LIVES. Exactly one placement per viewport, and this is
 * it. It used to have three at once: a permanently filled primary button in the
 * app header, a tab on the phone dock, and this row. The header button and the
 * tab are both gone. Below `lg` this file renders as the drawer and above it as
 * the rail, so on any given screen there is one Assistant control.

   * and an agent whose firm joins Vallo gains a third. Adding a second is not
   * a door into a room you are standing in.
   *
   * `!stays` hid it on the Stays side, where the founder has ruled the same
