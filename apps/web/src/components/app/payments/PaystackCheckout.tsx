/**
 * THE CHECKOUT THAT DOES NOT LEAVE.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES.
 *
 * Eight `window.location.assign(authorizationUrl)` calls. The tab that was
 * Vallo became the tab that was Paystack: their address bar, their page, and
 * our React tree destroyed, so a person who abandoned the payment and pressed
 * back arrived at a remounted panel with no memory of the attempt. On the
 * native shell it was worse still, because the in-app browser tab shows the
 * third party's URL in a chrome that is not ours.
 *
 * The whole server half of the fix was already built and thrown away on every
 * transaction this platform has ever taken. `initializeTransaction` returns
 * Paystack's `access_code` beside the authorisation URL, has done since the
 * file was written, and until this week nothing read it.
 * `PaystackPop.resumeTransaction(accessCode, callbacks)` resumes that exact
 * transaction inside an iframe on THIS page. No navigation, no new window, no
 * second address bar.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT WAS READ RATHER THAN ASSUMED, AND WHAT WAS NOT.
 *
 * Paystack's own hosts are refused by this session's egress policy, so none of
 * this could be run against a live test card here. What follows was read out
 * of `@paystack/inline-js` 2.25.0 itself, the published bundle, which is a
 * primary source:
 *
 *  - `resumeTransaction(accessCode, cbs)` calls `newTransaction({accessCode,
 *    ...cbs})`, and the parameter validator's FIRST statement is
 *    `if ("accessCode" in n) return { accessCode: n.accessCode }`. It returns
 *    before the required-parameter loop runs, so no public key is required or
 *    even looked at on this path. The one `publicKey` in the bundle is
 *    Paystack's own RSA key for encrypting card data, not a merchant key.
 *  - The iframe's src is `https://checkout.paystack.com/popup?precheckout=true`
 *    and that is the only checkout origin in the production config. It is
 *    appended to `document.body`, fixed, full-viewport, with
 *    `allow="payment; clipboard-read; clipboard-write"`.
 *  - There is no `window.open` anywhere in the bundle. Not one occurrence.
 *  - On the resume path the bundle makes NO network call from our page:
 *    `requestInline()`, the one `fetch` to `api.paystack.co`, is reached only
 *    from `checkout()` and `paymentRequest()`. That is why `connect-src` in
 *    `lib/security/csp.ts` can stay `'self'` plus Supabase.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL INFERENCE: that the bank's 3-D Secure page renders inside that
 * same iframe rather than opening something. The absence of `window.open` in
 * the bundle makes it very hard for it to do anything else, but the ACS page
 * is served by the bank into Paystack's checkout document, which this side
 * cannot see. `docs/BUILD_07_LEDGER.md` carries the test that settles it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE RESOLUTION LOOP: THREE SIGNALS, NONE OF THEM TRUSTED ALONE.
 *
 * 1. `onSuccess` from the popup. Fastest, and treated as a HINT. It is a
 *    message from an iframe; it is never what makes money real.
 * 2. The webhook, unchanged, which is what actually posts the ledger row and
 *    wins every race by construction.
 * 3. A bounded poll of OUR OWN server, every two seconds for ninety seconds,
 *    through the `confirm` prop. This covers the case `onSuccess` never fires:
 *    the iframe was killed, iOS backgrounded the WebView, the network dropped
 *    between Pusher and us.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AND THE THING THIS COMPONENT WILL NOT DO.
 *
 * IT NEVER NAVIGATES ANYWHERE BY ITSELF. When the library cannot load at all,
 * the honest answer is not to quietly fall back to the hosted page, because
 * that is the exact behaviour the founder asked us to stop. It says what
 * happened, names the destination, and offers the hosted page as a control the
 * person presses on purpose. A deliberate choice to leave is not us throwing
 * somebody out.
