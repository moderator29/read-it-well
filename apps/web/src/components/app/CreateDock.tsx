/**
 * THE DOCK'S "+" AT THE RIGHT END, AND THE SHEET IT OPENS.
 *
 * It stood in the capsule's centre slot until the founder's swap of 13 October
 * 2026 put the grid menu there and moved the "+" out to the round button at the
 * right end, brand blue with its glow. The sheet does not move: it is a bottom
 * sheet (`Sheet`, a portal on the body that joins the overlay registry, so the
 * Android back button closes it) and opens the same from either place. Focus
 * returns to this button when it closes.
 *
 * THE SHEET, SINCE 13 OCTOBER 2026 (the founder, replacing the plain titles of
 * 7 October, handoff A.6): three clear options at the top, in this order, each
 * with a clean monochrome icon, one line and a short line under it.
 *
 *   Post to story    the existing story composer (`/stories/new`)
 *   Post to feed     the existing post composer for Around (`/around?compose=1`)
 *   List a property  the existing listing route for the person's side (the
 *                    agent wizard for an agent, the side's chooser otherwise);
 *                    on the Stays side "Create a stay listing"
 *
 * Nothing the sheet offered is removed: "Book a viewing" (Property) and "Book a
 * stay" (Stays) stay, below the three, as a quieter row. With the `social`
 * switch off there is no feed and no story to post to, so those two are not
 * offered rather than leading to a paused screen, and "List" stays. A GUEST
 * cannot post or list, so each option goes through the existing sign-up door
 * and returns to the destination afterwards (`withNext`); booking is public
 * and goes straight there.
 *
 * Switch workspace LEFT this sheet. It is about accounts, not about making
 * something, and it lives where accounts live: the Switch role row on
 * `/profile` (`SwitchRoleRow`), which fires the same named event
 * (`profile-switcher-event.ts`) that the workspace sheet in `AppShell`
 * listens for. Nothing it did is lost; it is one place, not two.
 *
 * The disc turns a quarter into its own close as the sheet opens (north star
 * 6.1, nav-island.css). That stays.
 *
 * `data-dock-create` marks the button for tests and screenshots, so neither
 * depends on a class name.
