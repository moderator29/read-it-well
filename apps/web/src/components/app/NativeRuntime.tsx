/**
 * Mounts the native runtime. Renders nothing.
 *
 * Modelled on `ServiceWorkerRegistrar`, which sits beside it in the root
 * layout and solves the same shape of problem: a capability that belongs to
 * the whole application, has no UI of its own, and must be started exactly
 * once from a place every route passes through.
 *
 * It exists as a component for one reason that could not be solved inside
 * `lib/native/`: the hardware back button has to know where it is, and both the
 * current path and the Next router are React context. So this component holds
 * them and hands the runtime the single capability it cannot reach for itself.
 * Everything else the runtime does is plain DOM and plugin work and stays out
 * of React entirely.
 *
 * ON THE WEB THIS IS A NO-OP AND COSTS NOTHING. `startNativeRuntime` returns
 * immediately unless the Capacitor bridge is present, and every plugin is
 * behind a dynamic import that a browser never requests. Mounting it in the
 * root layout therefore changes nothing at all about the website, which is the
 * condition of it being allowed there. Nothing Capacitor is imported HERE for
 * exactly that reason, which is also why the decision to close the application
 * lives in `lib/native/back-button.ts` and not in this file.
 *
 * WHY ANDROID IS THE WORST PLACE FOR THE OLD BUG.
 *
 * This handler used to be `if (canGoBackInApp()) router.back();`. On a screen
 * reached by a redirect, a sign-in bounce or a push notification's deep link,
 * the previous entry is not the parent, so the hardware button walked sideways
 * into whatever the machinery had done. And when the answer was NO,
 * `startBackButton` closed the application - so a person who opened a message
 * from a notification and pressed back had the shell vanish rather than land in
 * their inbox. Both halves are gone: the hierarchy decides where back goes, and
 * only a declared ROOT may close the shell.
