/**
 * THE DISCOVERY EMPTY STATE (Session 3, W2; north star 10 B, motion 21).
 *
 * Every discovery surface is empty until supply arrives, so this is not an
 * edge case: on the day it shipped it was what home, search, stays,
 * restaurants and the shortlist actually showed. It is therefore built as a
 * screen in its own right rather than a fallback, with three parts and an
 * order that does not change:
 *
 *   1. THE OBJECT, settling in. A tiered asset (D29: a real place when the
 *      shelf is about places, a matte symbol when it is about an idea), drawn
 *      on a radius-14 ground in light so it never floats on white (14.7). It
 *      drops 12px onto the ground and settles on `drift` at 520ms (motion 21),
 *      which says "this is where things will arrive" rather than decorating.
 *   2. THE HONEST REASON, which fades in only after the object has landed, so
 *      the eye reads the object first and the sentence second. One title, one
 *      sentence, true of the state the reader is in.
 *   3. A WAY TO CAPTURE THE DEMAND. An empty shelf is still a person who wants
 *      something, and the platform has a real place to put that want (a brief
 *      listers answer with a listing, a saved search that tells you the minute
 *      a match goes live). `capture` is that slot, drawn under the action as a
 *      quiet line, never a second primary.
 *
 * Server-safe: no hooks and no client boundary. The motion is a stylesheet
 * entrance on the tokens, so reduced motion, Calm and Off collapse it the way
 * they collapse every other entrance (`motion-pref.css`), and nothing here
 * waits on a script to be readable.
