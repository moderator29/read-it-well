/**
 * "New since your last visit", for the shelf (V-22).
 *
 * The reader's previous visit to the shelf is remembered on this device only:
 * one timestamp in localStorage, nothing sent anywhere, nothing that needs an
 * account. On mount the provider reads the old value (that is the "last
 * visit") and then writes now, so a listing is marked New exactly once per
 * visit after it went live.
 *
 * WHY THE FIRST VISIT MARKS NOTHING. With no previous visit there is nothing
 * for "new" to be new against, and marking the whole shelf New on somebody's
 * first look would be a word that means nothing. Storage that is blocked
 * (a private window, a web view that refuses it) is the same case.
 *
 * The value is read after hydration, so the server render and the first
 * client render agree (nothing is marked), and the marks appear a frame later.
