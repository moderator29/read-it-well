 * The floating Map / List switch on a phone (Track M), the pattern every

 * shelf between the results and the map. A link, not a button, because the
 * view lives in the address. From 640px it is hidden and the bar's toggle
 * does the job (list-views.css).
 *
 * It rises in once when the shelf arrives and presses at 0.98; reduced motion
 * gets neither.
