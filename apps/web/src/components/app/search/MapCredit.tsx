/**
 * THE MAP'S CREDIT, BEHIND A ROUND "i" (search-map track, 13 October 2026).
 *
 * MapTiler's and OpenStreetMap's terms require their credit on the map, and
 * they allow it to be compact: MapLibre's own `compact` attribution is a round
 * "i" that opens the credit on a tap. The founder wanted the line of text off
 * the map, so this is that pattern: the credit is always one tap away, it is
 * a real disclosure (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`), Escape and a second
 * tap close it, and the links inside are the providers' own pages, in the
 * order their terms ask for. `credits` comes from `lib/maps/tiles.ts`, which
 * names whichever provider is actually serving tiles, so a provider swap
 * cannot leave a stale name here.
 *
 * `note` carries anything else the map has to say about itself that is not a
 * state (pins placed on an area rather than an address), so it sits with the
 * credit rather than as a second line over the map.
