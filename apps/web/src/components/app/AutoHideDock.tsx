/**
 * The dock, out of the way while somebody is reading.
 *
 * Inbox item 212. The tab bar is a floating dock roughly 64px tall sitting
 * over the bottom of a 390px screen, which is a real fraction of a phone, and
 * it sits there permanently. Reading a list of places is exactly when
 * navigation is not the question, and exactly when the bottom eighth of the
 * screen is worth the most.
 *
 * Scrolling down hides it. Scrolling up brings it straight back, because
 * reaching for navigation IS an upward gesture: the thumb flicks up, the dock
 * arrives under it. No delay, no timer, nothing to wait for.
 *
 * Four rules stop it becoming a guessing game:
 *
 *   It never hides in the top 96px of a page. A dock that vanishes on the
 *   first flick of a screen the reader has barely entered reads as a glitch
 *   rather than as an affordance.
 *
 *   It never hides at the bottom of a page. Somebody who has scrolled to the
 *   end of a list should not have to scroll back up to leave.
 *
 *   It ignores movements under 8px, so a rubber-band bounce, a momentum
 *   settle or a thumb resting on the glass does not flicker it.
 *
 *   It comes back on focus, in CSS, so a keyboard reaching the dock while it
 *   is hidden reveals it rather than tabbing into something invisible.
 *
 * A NEW SCREEN ALWAYS STARTS WITH THE DOCK IN PLACE, and it used to be done by
 * remounting. The call site keyed this component on the active route, so a
 * navigation threw the node away and built a new one. That was the right answer
 * to a real problem, and two softer approaches had been tried and measured and
 * failed the same way: a dock hidden when the reader tapped Explore was still
 * hidden on the search screen, at scroll position zero, with nothing to scroll
 * up from. Resetting the state during render is not enough, because an app
 * navigation is a transition and the render that resets it is not the one that
 * commits. Waiting for the first scroll event is not enough, because a
 * navigation to the top of a page fires none.
 *
 * THE REMOUNT HAD A COST NOBODY HAD CHARGED IT FOR. The tab bar's highlight is
 * a single element that travels from the old tab to the new one, and an element
 * that is destroyed and rebuilt cannot travel: it can only appear, already
 * arrived. So the bar cut between destinations and no amount of CSS was going
 * to fix it, because the DOM node the CSS would have animated did not survive
 * the navigation.
 *
 * So the state REMEMBERS WHICH SCREEN IT WAS DECIDED ON, which is the third
 * approach and the one neither of the first two was. "Hidden" is not a fact
 * about the dock, it is a fact about a reader scrolling down a particular
 * screen, and the moment they are on a different screen it is not an answer to
 * anything. Comparing beats correcting: there is no second render, nothing to
 * schedule, and no frame in which the new screen shows the old screen's answer.
 * The node survives, the pill travels, and a new screen still starts with the
 * dock in place.
 *
 * The wrapper is a client component holding only this behaviour. The dock
 * itself stays a server component, which matters: it is handed the whole
 * dictionary, and turning it into a client component would serialise all of it
 * into the payload of every app page.
