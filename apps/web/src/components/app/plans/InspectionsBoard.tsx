/**
 * The inspections on Plans: the Property side's diary, in the anatomy of
 * F6A8A482. It was the whole of `/inspections`, which is folded into
 * `/bookings` (V-76) and now redirects there with `?kind=inspection`.
 *
 * A person can be both sides of this table: the flat they rent and the one
 * they let. Both lists are read by the page (so the dated list above and this
 * board agree), each row is tagged with the side it was read from, which
 * decides the controls and whose move it is, and they show as two groups.
 * OPEN is anything still ahead of you; CLOSED is a record.
 *
 * Each inspection is one sheet: the scheduled listing card, the date and
 * party and state row, the ladder, the notes, and the two actions. The first
 * open one arrives expanded; the rest fold to their card. Every sheet sits
 * under an `ix-<id>` anchor so a row in the dated list can land on it.
 *
 * Either read failing makes the board say so: a list that is half true is not
 * a list somebody can act on. `changed` (from `?changed=<id>`, how the thread
 * banner hands over a row just answered there) arrives expanded instead of
 * the first. With nothing to show, the board draws nothing and the page's
 * own empty state speaks.
