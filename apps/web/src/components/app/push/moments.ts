/**
 * WHEN TO ASK FOR THE NOTIFICATION PERMISSION, AND WHEN NEVER TO.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE ONE FACT THAT MAKES THIS FILE NECESSARY.
 *
 * ASKING ON FIRST LAUNCH IS HOW AN APPLICATION GETS REFUSED PERMANENTLY. On
 * iOS a declined system prompt cannot be shown again, ever: the only way back
 * is the Settings app, and almost nobody goes. On the web a denied permission
 * cannot be re-prompted from the page at all. There is exactly one system
 * prompt per install and it is spent the first time it is shown.
 *
 * So the system prompt is never the first thing a person sees. A Vallo screen
 * comes first, in our own words, saying precisely what will be sent and
 * offering Not now. Only a Yes on that screen may call the system API. A No
 * on our screen costs nothing, because our screen can be shown again and the
 * system's cannot.
 *
 * This is also what the Android manifest has said all along in its own words:
 * do not spend the one prompt a person reliably grants on a channel that
 * cannot deliver anything. That comment was right, and it stays right; what
 * changes is that the channel can now deliver.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * ASK AT THE MOMENT THE VALUE IS OBVIOUS, WHICH IS ALWAYS A MOMENT OF
 * SUCCESS, NEVER A MOMENT OF FRICTION.
 *
 * Every moment below is immediately after a person has just done something
 * that worked, and every offer names the specific thing they will now not
 * miss. A person who has just published a listing wants to know when somebody
 * asks about it; a person who has just sent a booking request wants to know
 * when the host answers. That is a very different question from one asked on
 * a home screen, and it converts differently by a large multiple.
 *
 * NEVER on the home screen. NEVER on sign-up. NEVER on a payment screen: a
 * permission dialogue over a payment reads as a trick and costs the payment
 * as well as the permission.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS PURE. It takes a moment and a small record of what has
 * been asked before and returns a verdict. No browser API is touched, so
 * every rule below is testable, which matters because the cost of getting the
 * re-ask rule wrong is not a bug report, it is a person who has silently
 * turned the application off.
