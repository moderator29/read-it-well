/**
 * THE NOTIFICATION CONTROL ON THE SETTINGS SCREEN.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * A SETTINGS SCREEN IS NOT A MOMENT, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS WHY THIS FILE
 * EXISTS RATHER THAN A BARE `<PushPrompt moment="settings_opened" />`.
 *
 * `moments.ts` is about INTERRUPTIONS. It will not offer twice in thirty days
 * and will not offer a third time ever, which is exactly right for a prompt
 * that appears over something a person was already doing. It applies those
 * rules to every moment including `settings_opened`.
 *
 * On `/settings/notifications` that is the wrong answer and it is wrong in a
 * costly direction. Nobody arrives here by accident. A person who said Not
 * now twice and then came looking for the switch a week later would find the
 * screen silent, with no way to turn notifications on and nothing saying why.
 * That is a dead end built out of politeness.
 *
 * So the rules still decide whether the PROMPT is shown, with its careful
 * copy about what will be sent. When they say no, a plain control is shown
 * instead. A person who came to ask us can always say yes.
 *
 * This is recorded as a defect in the inherited design rather than fixed in
 * `moments.ts`, because the four moments are a closed contract with 41 tests
 * behind them and the fault is not in the rules, it is in applying rules
 * about interruption to a screen that is not one.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE THREE STATES THAT ARE NOT "ASK".
 *
 * GRANTED: there is nothing to ask for, but there may still be something to
 * do. A device whose row was retired from the list below still has the
 * browser permission, so the control stays and re-enrolling is one tap.
 * `/api/push/register` upserts on the token and clears `revoked_at`, so it is
 * safe to press repeatedly and never makes a second row.
 *
 * DENIED: THE SYSTEM PROMPT IS SPENT. On iOS a refusal is effectively
 * permanent and on the web a denied permission cannot be re-prompted from the
 * page at all. Offering a button that leads nowhere would be worse than
 * saying nothing, so the screen says where the only remaining route is: their
 * own browser or phone settings.
 *
 * UNSUPPORTED: an older Android browser, or iOS Safari on a site that has not
 * been added to the home screen, where web push does not exist. Named
 * plainly, with the one thing that would change it.

 * the server, and React has one supported way to read such a thing without
 * either a hydration mismatch or a set-state-in-effect that triggers a

 * answer arrives on the hydration pass, and no lint rule has to be disabled

 *
 * On 23 September the founder allowed notifications in the iPhone home screen
 * app, signed in, and the control read as on. `push_tokens` had never held a
 * row. `/api/push/key` was answering 401 to that app (the route was gated and
 * the home screen app keeps a cookie store of its own), the subscribe never
 * happened, and the control had decided it was on from
 * `Notification.permission`. On the first tap it showed a failure note for as
 * long as the page lived; on every load after that permission read "granted",
 * the phase went straight to the granted copy ("Notifications are allowed on
 * this device") and there was no note at all. A light and no words.
 *
 * Permission is a fact about the browser. A later fix read ON from the
 * account's device COUNT, which lights this phone because of a row belonging
 * to a laptop. Now ON needs all of `deviceIsLive` in `device-state.ts`: the
 * `device_ref` that `/api/push/register` gave THIS device, found among the
 * live refs the page just read from the database, with the browser still
 * holding the endpoint that was registered. Until that check has run, the
 * control reads off.
 *
 * Every failed attempt settles the phase and says one plain sentence
 * (`failureMessage`); no failure may leave the screen silent.
