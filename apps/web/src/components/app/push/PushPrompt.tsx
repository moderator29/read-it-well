/**
 * THE SCREEN THAT COMES BEFORE THE SYSTEM PROMPT.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THERE IS A SCREEN AT ALL, WHEN THE SYSTEM ALREADY HAS ONE.
 *
 * Because the system's can only be shown once. On iOS a refusal is effectively
 * permanent; on the web a denied permission cannot be re-prompted from the
 * page. So the expensive question is asked only after a cheap one has already
 * been answered yes. A No here costs nothing and can be asked again in a
 * month. A No there costs the channel for the life of the install.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THREE THINGS THIS COMPONENT WILL NOT DO.
 *
 * IT WILL NOT APPEAR ON A COLD START. It takes a `moment`, and the four
 * moments in `moments.ts` are all immediately after something has gone right
 * for the person. A caller that mounts this on a home screen has misused it,
 * and the moments are a closed union so that misuse has to be deliberate.
 *
 * IT WILL NOT ASK TWICE IN A MONTH, OR THREE TIMES EVER. `offerVerdict`
 * decides, this only renders.
 *
 * IT WILL NOT TOUCH THE SYSTEM PROMPT EXCEPT FROM THE YES HANDLER, in the
 * same tick as the click. `Notification.requestPermission()` is gated on user
 * activation and an await before it can lose the gesture, so `enrol` is
 * called directly from `onClick` with nothing awaited first.
