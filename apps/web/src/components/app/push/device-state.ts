/**
 * WHETHER THIS DEVICE IS ON, AND WHAT TO SAY WHEN IT IS NOT.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE BLIND LIGHT, 23 SEPTEMBER.
 *
 * The founder allowed notifications inside the iPhone home screen app, signed
 * in, and the settings control read as on. `push_tokens` had never held a row.
 * The control had decided it was on from `Notification.permission`, which is a
 * fact about the BROWSER. It says nothing about whether Vallo can reach the
 * device. Nor does a local `PushSubscription`: a browser will happily hold one
 * that the server never recorded.
 *
 * So there is exactly one way for the control to read ON, and it needs the
 * server's word for THIS device, not for the account:
 *
 *   1. `/api/push/register` answered ok for this device and gave back its
 *      `device_ref`, which is recorded here in `localStorage`; and
 *   2. the settings page, server rendered from `push_tokens` where
 *      `revoked_at is null`, lists that same `device_ref` as live; and
 *   3. on the web, the browser still holds the subscription whose endpoint was
 *      registered (a browser that rotated or dropped it is a device we can no
 *      longer reach, whatever the row says); and
 *   4. the permission is still granted.
 *
 * A second device registered on the same account does not light this one.
 * The account-wide count the page used to pass is not enough on its own, and
 * it is only kept as a prop so the older call site still compiles.
 *
 * Pure functions, no React and no DOM, so the rules are tested in the node
 * suite rather than trusted.
