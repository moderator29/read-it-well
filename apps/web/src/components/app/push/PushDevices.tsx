/**
 * THE LIST THAT MAKES THE PERMISSION REVERSIBLE.
 *
 * Without it, push is something a person can switch on and cannot switch off
 * except by uninstalling Vallo. That is not a setting, it is an ultimatum,
 * and it is the reason this component exists before any of the nicer ones.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * EVERY STRING ON THE SCREEN IS DECIDED ABOVE THIS FILE, EXCEPT THE VERBS.
 *
 * The rows arrive already formatted by the server component, so this holds no
 * copy of the device data and cannot drift from it. The actions call
 * `revalidatePath` and the page re-renders from the database, which is what
 * stops the screen ever saying a device is still live after it was retired.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * CONFIRM THEN ACT, PER ROW, AND `armed` IS ONE PIECE OF STATE RATHER THAN A
 * FLAG PER ROW.
 *
 * Arming a second control disarms the first by construction, so somebody who
 * changes their mind and taps a different row cannot retire the wrong device
 * with the tap that was meant to select it. This is the same pattern as
 * `/settings/devices`, on purpose: two screens about turning devices off
 * should not behave differently.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THERE IS NO TOKEN ON THIS SCREEN AND NONE IN THIS FILE'S PROPS.
 *
 * `ref` is `push_tokens.device_ref`: twelve hex characters the database
 * generates from the token, not reversible, and there so a person with two
 * Android phones can tell their two rows apart. Read it aloud to support if
 * you like. It reaches nobody's handset.
