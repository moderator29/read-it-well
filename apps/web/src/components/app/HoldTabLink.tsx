/**
 * A DOCK TAB THAT KEEPS THE CURRENT SCREEN UP UNTIL THE NEXT ONE IS READY (13
 * October 2026, the startup track).
 *
 * A tap on a tab whose copy is fresh navigates at once and the router draws
 * the tab straight from that copy, inside its own transition, so the old
 * screen stays until the new one paints. `KeepWarm` keeps the tabs that way.
 *
 * A tap on a tab whose copy is NOT fresh (the first second after the app
 * opens or comes back, while `KeepWarm`'s fetch is still on its way) used to
 * swap the screen for the tab's skeleton at once. Now the tap asks for the
 * tab whole and keeps the current screen up until it arrives, HOLD_MAX_MS at
 * most, then navigates: with the copy there, the tab is drawn whole, with no
 * skeleton between. The dock answers the finger at once all the same: the
 * tapped tab takes the pill on the tap (`AutoHideDock`, `data-on`).
 *
 * A second tap on the same tab, or the hold running out, navigates at once,
 * and a tap on another tab replaces the hold. Where the browser's resource
 * timing cannot be read, or holds keep running out on a slow link
 * (`shouldHold`), the tap navigates at once exactly as a plain link does. In
 * development nothing is prefetched, so nothing is held.
