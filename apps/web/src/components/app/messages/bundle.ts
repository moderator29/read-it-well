/**
 * Photo bundles: consecutive photo-only messages from one sender, sent in the
 * same minute, drawn as one bubble with a three-up strip and a +n plate; and
 * the words that follow them in that same minute ride the bubble as its
 * caption, which is how 9E06F51C draws "here are more photos" under the strip.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DERIVED AT RENDER TIME. A photo lands as its own message row
 * (see `attachImage`), so somebody sending six pictures of a flat sends six
 * messages, and six full-width bubbles in a row is the thing the render
 * (9E06F51C) does not draw. Nothing about the rows changes; the thread just
 * reads a run of them as one act, which is what the sender meant.
 *
 * Pure, so it is tested rather than trusted.
