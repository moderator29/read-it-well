/**
 * FORWARD, THE CHOOSER'S RULES (founder, 11 October 2026). Pure, so it is
 * tested rather than trusted.
 *
 * Forward sends a message's words into another of the reader's conversations,
 * through `forward_message` (migration 20261011142309), which holds every rule
 * that matters: the reader must be in both conversations, must follow the
 * person on the other side, and neither may have blocked the other. The
 * chooser only offers what that function would take, so a refusal is rare and,
 * when it comes, it is the database's own sentence.
 *
 *   WHAT CAN BE FORWARDED: a sent message with words. Not a photo (the
 *   function refuses one: "photos cannot be forwarded yet"), not a voice note
 *   or a file, not a card, not a call, not a message deleted for everyone, and
 *   not a bubble still on its way.
 *
 *   WHERE IT CAN GO: the reader's conversations whose other side they follow,
 *   read from the inbox's own summaries (the follow comes from `public.follows`
 *   through `readViewerFollowing`), never the conversation it came from.
