/**
 * B12, THE SCAM SHIELD ON A MESSAGE YOU RECEIVED.
 *
 * One calm tinted row under a bubble from the other side that asks you to pay
 * outside Vallo (`offPlatformAsk` decides). It is drawn for the reader only:
 * nothing is sent, and the sender is never told. It is a note, not an alarm:
 * no red, no motion, one icon and the founder's sentence, then two quiet
 * actions:
 *
 *   What to do   opens three short steps in place (do not transfer, pay on
 *                Vallo with the platform's own payment sentence, report);
 *   Report       the platform's own report sheet, on this message.
 *
 * The money sentences are the constants in `lib/money/copy.ts`, so the shield
 * can never say something about payment that the Terms do not.
 *
 * THE MENTION (founder ruling 7, 13 October 2026). In a listing chat, when
 * either side mentions an account number or a transfer (`mentionsPayingOutside`),
 * the same row is drawn with the founder's line as its lead: "Pay only through
 * Vallo. Payments made outside Vallo are not covered." On both sides and under
 * the reader's own message too; Report is offered only on a message from the
 * other side. One shield, two leads, never two rows on one message.
