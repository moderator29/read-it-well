/**
 * WHERE A PLACE GOES WHEN SOMEBODY SHARES IT.
 *
 * The founder's complaint was exact: he could not send a property to
 * somebody's DMs. Every piece of that path already existed apart from the way
 * in. `/messages/share/<kind>/<id>` lists the sharer's own conversations under
 * RLS and sends a real message through `sendMessage`, and the thread expands
 * that message into a card. What the listing, stay and restaurant pages had
 * was one button that copied a link to the clipboard, which is how you send a
 * place to somebody who is NOT on Vallo.
 *
 * So the control asks which of the two it is, and the first answer is the one
 * the product is for. Two rows, both real:
 *
 *   SEND IN A VALLO CHAT goes to the picker, which is a page rather than a
 *   sheet on purpose (see that route's own note): a narrowed list of somebody's
 *   conversations is a URL, and the picker has to be able to say "you have no
 *   conversations yet" without collapsing this sheet under it.
 *
 *   SHARE ELSEWHERE is the browser's own sheet where there is one and the
 *   clipboard where there is not, which is what the button used to do on its
 *   own.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES. The sheet only routes; the write is the picker's, where
 * `messages.sender_id` is the signed-in caller and `lib/messages/blocks.ts`
 * decides whether the conversation may receive a message at all.
