/**
 * The consumer shell, for both sides.
 *
 * The single wrapper for every consumer page, so the navigation is identical
 * everywhere rather than living on the home route alone. On `lg` and up the
 * sticky `AppRail` sits beside the content; below `lg` the rail is gone and the
 * fixed `MobileTabBar` carries navigation, with the main column padded so
 * nothing hides behind it. The active destination is read from the current path
 * here, so the highlight stays correct as the user moves around without each
 * page having to pass it in.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE HEADER LOST THREE CONTROLS AND THE SHELL LOST A WHOLE NAVIGATION SURFACE.
 *
 * The app bar carried six controls on every screen: the drawer toggle, the
 * wordmark, a language switcher, a theme toggle, a permanently filled AI
 * Assistant button, the notification bell and the avatar. Three of those had no
 * business being there:
 *
 *  - **Language** is a choice somebody makes once, and it is a card on
 *    `/settings`. A permanent control for a once-ever decision is a control
 *    that is wrong 99.9% of the time it is on screen.
 *  - **Theme** is the same argument, and it is a card on `/settings` too.
 *  - **The assistant** was the loudest thing on the bar - filled primary, brand
 *    gradient, on every route - and it was ALSO a tab on the phone dock and
 *    ALSO a row in the rail. Three placements for one feature. It keeps the
 *    one in the side navigation, which renders as the rail on desktop and the
 *    drawer on a phone, so it has exactly one placement per viewport.
 *
 * **The desktop dock is gone entirely.** It was a floating pill fixed over the
 * bottom of the content offering Notifications, Messages and Settings - all
 * three of which are rows in the rail, three inches away, permanently visible
 * on the same viewport the dock only appeared on. It was a second navigation
 * competing with the first, and on the listing page it fought the sticky action
 * bar for the bottom edge, which is why `pinsActionBar` existed. That special
 * case is gone with it.
 *
 * WHAT THE HEADER CARRIES NOW: the drawer toggle and the wordmark on a phone,
 * then either the bell and the avatar (signed in) or Sign up and Log in
 * (signed out).

            THE SIGNED-OUT HEADER OVERFLOWED AT 390 AND CLIPPED ITS OWN PRIMARY
            CONTROL, AND NOTHING SCROLLED.

            A2 measured it on `/verification`: the actions group's right edge
            landed at 407px inside a 390px viewport, so about seventeen pixels
            of "Sign up" were cut off, while `document.scrollWidth` stayed 390.
            That last number is what made it a defect rather than a squeeze: an
            overflowing flex row does not extend the scrollport, so the clipped
            part of the button could not be reached by ANY gesture. The one
            control a signed-out visitor is there to press was partly not there.

            THREE THINGS WERE SPENDING WIDTH AND NONE OF THEM WOULD GIVE IT UP.
            The hamburger and the actions are both `shrink-0`, correctly: a
            control you cannot read is a control you cannot use. The lockup was
            fixed at a 40px mark plus a 19px wordmark, about 134px, on a row
            that has 342px after the gutters. And a `flex-1` SPACER sat between
            the lockup and the actions, which costs nothing in width itself but
            costs a `gap-sm` on each side of it, so the row paid for four gaps
            where three would do.

            THE FIX IS THAT THE BRAND GIVES WAY, because it is the only item
            here that can lose size without losing meaning. `responsive` scales
            the mark and the wordmark with the viewport (`clamp`), which at 390
            draws the lockup at about 114px instead of 134 and at full size from
            a tablet up. The spacer is gone and the actions push themselves over
            with `ms-auto`, which returns the fourth gap. Measured after: the
            actions' right edge is inside the gutter at 390 and `scrollWidth`
            still equals the viewport, which is now true because nothing
            overflows rather than because the overflow was unreachable.

            It is the same family as the `minmax(0, 1fr)` finding already in the
            ledger: freeing the TRACK and never the ITEM. A flex row whose
            children all refuse to shrink does not wrap and does not scroll, it
            simply paints past its own edge.
