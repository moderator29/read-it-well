/**
 * A WAY TO FIND, ON A SETTINGS HOME THAT IS NOW A HUB.
 *
 * The search is a plain GET, not a client filter. The answer belongs in the
 * address: a narrowed settings screen is then a link somebody can send to the
 * person they are helping over the phone, the back button walks the narrowing
 * backwards, a reload lands on the same rows, and it costs no JavaScript to
 * type on a connection where a bundle is the difference between working and
 * waiting.
 *
 * The index is built out of the dictionary blocks the screens render from, so
 * there is no second copy of any label to go stale: somebody searching
 * "Hausa" lands on the screen that actually holds the language control.
 *
 * Each match is a LINK to the screen that holds the setting, because the home
 * no longer holds them all: the hub rows lead to `/settings/account`,
 * `/settings/notifications`, `/settings/privacy`, `/settings/appearance` and
 * `/settings/help`, and a search result goes where the row goes.
