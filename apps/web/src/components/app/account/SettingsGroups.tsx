/**
 * The settings groups, as rows.
 *
 * These were seven cards, each with a 44px illustrated tile, an overline, and
 * its own inner layout: a segmented chip row here, a bare `<select>` there, a
 * full-width button somewhere else. Every group was defensible and the stack
 * had no rhythm at all. On a 390px phone it read as seven separate screens
 * stacked, and finding one preference meant reading all of them.
 *
 * Now every group is the same object: a quiet label outside a card, and inside
 * it rows that all begin at the same vertical. The change that matters most is
 * that **a row states its own value**. "Theme" told you nothing; "Theme   Dark"
 * has answered before you touched it, and most visits to a settings screen are
 * to check something rather than to change it.
 *
 * The single-choice controls became native selects rather than chip rows.
 * Three chips for a theme were fine; three chips for a theme, three for text
 * size, two for units and two for visibility were ten chips competing for the
 * same attention. A select collapses each to its answer and opens the picker
 * the phone already has.
 *
 * Everything on this file is stored on the device and applies to the device.
 * The account-backed groups live in `app/(app)/settings/AccountToggles.tsx` and
 * draw from the same primitives, so the two look identical and only the storage
 * differs.
 *
 * Every group takes `t` as a prop. There is no locale context on this platform:
 * the server component that resolved the cookie hands the dictionary down, the
 * same way `components/app/place/PlaceFields.tsx` receives it. A client
 * component that reached for the locale itself would resolve it a second time
 * and could disagree with the tree it is rendering inside.

 * choose; the row, its three options and the store behind them are deleted
 * rather than pinned to Dark, because a control that still has a setter is a
 * control somebody gives a second value back to.
 *
 * Text size scales the root font size, which every rem measure in the app
 * follows. Both settings apply instantly and persist on this device.
