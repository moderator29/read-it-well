/**
 * Help and support, AI first.
 *
 * The card opens a real support conversation: replies stream token by token
 * from /api/support, where a grounded agent answers from Vallo's canonical
 * help notes and, for a signed-in person, from their own bookings and wallet
 * read under their own Row Level Security. When it should stop trying it files
 * a real support ticket and hands back the VAL-SUP reference the database gave,
 * which lands in this thread as a receipt.
 *
 * Two promises the surface keeps whatever happens. Talk to a person is visible
 * at all times, never buried behind a failed answer, and it collects a name and
 * an email and nothing else. And when the platform has no model key, the route
 * says so honestly and this surface falls back to the keyword help store, so
 * support answers the common questions rather than going dark.
 *
 * The thread lives under `nf_support_thread` on this device and survives
 * navigation and reloads.
