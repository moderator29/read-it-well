/**
 * The heart, on anything that shows a listing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A COMPONENT AT ALL.
 *
 * The save loop was written three times and rendered in two places. The
 * detail page had it, the map's dock had it, and `/saved` had the half of it
 * that removes. THE GRID DID NOT, so the same flat was savable in Map view and
 * not savable in List view, and `/saved`'s own empty state said "Tap the heart
 * on any place and it waits for you here" about a control the grid did not
 * offer. Saving is the cheapest step in the funnel and it was costing a page
 * load per property on a product whose whole job is comparison.
 *
 * So the optimistic flip, the revert, the device fallback and the two stores
 * live here once, and a surface renders one element.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A SIGNED-OUT TAP IS KEPT, NOT REFUSED. This is the part worth reading.
 *
 * `lib/saved/actions.ts` says in its own header: "Signed out, a platform
 * listing returns the sign-in envelope. The tap is not lost: the client has
 * already written the save locally and re-plays it once the account exists."
 * That was the intent and no client did it. `ListingActions` reverts the heart
 * and raises a sign-in prompt, so the tap IS lost, and on a card in a grid a
 * prompt is worse still: twenty cards cannot each carry a dialogue.
 *
 * Here, the signed-out envelope is treated as the device's answer. The save
 * goes to localStorage and to the cookie mirror, the heart stays on, and
 * `/saved` renders it on the next server paint because the cookie is read
 * there already. Nothing is promised that is not true: the caption says the
 * save is on this device, because that is where it is.
 *
 * The message is matched on its opening words rather than on the exported
 * constant, because `SIGNED_OUT_MESSAGE` lives in a `server-only` module and
 * cannot be imported into a client component. `ListingActions` matches it the
 * same way. It is a seam, and it is named here so the next reader can see it
 * rather than discover it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT SAYS, AND WHERE.
 *
 * A card in a grid has no room for a toast and must not change height when one
 * arrives, because a row of cards that reflows under a thumb is how a person
 * taps the wrong property. So the note is rendered by the CALLER, wherever it
 * has space that is already reserved, and this component only decides what the
 * words are. On the card that space is the media band, which is a fixed ratio.

/* ------------------------------------------------- the device's shortlist */

/**
 * The device half of the shortlist, as a store every heart on the screen reads.
 *
 * WHY NOT AN EFFECT. The obvious version is `useEffect(() => { if
 * (readLocalSaves().has(id)) setSaved(true) })`, which is what the detail page
 * does. It works and it costs a second render per card, so twenty cards in a
 * grid is twenty cascading renders after hydration, and `react-hooks/
 * set-state-in-effect` is right to complain about it.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` is the answer React added for exactly this shape:
 * server state that the client can see and the server cannot. The server
 * snapshot is `false`, the client snapshot is the truth, and the hearts that
 * belong to the same listing on two surfaces move together because they read
 * one store.
 *
 * THE SNAPSHOT IS CACHED PER VERSION, and it has to be. `getSnapshot` runs on
 * every render, `readLocalSaves` parses localStorage and `document.cookie`, and
 * a store that returns a fresh object every call makes React loop. The version
 * counter moves only when this module writes.
