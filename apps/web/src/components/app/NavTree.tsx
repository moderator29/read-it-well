/**
 * The navigation list, for both modes.
 *
 * Personal Mode and Agent Mode used to have two navigations that looked like
 * two products: one stroked glyph list with a brand-blue pill, one column of
 * 26px 3D tiles with an agent-green one. An agent switching between them was
 * learning a second interface for the same job. This renders both from the same
 * `NavSection[]`, with one prop deciding the accent.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IT IS NO LONGER A TREE, AND THAT IS THE CHANGE.
 *
 * This file used to render parents with children: a disclosure arrow, an open
 * set persisted per mode in localStorage, a seeded set so the group containing
 * the current page opened on arrival, a tree line down the children, and a rule
 * that the parent's label navigated while only the arrow expanded. Roughly a
 * third of the code and every hard part of it.
 *
 * All of it is gone, because the sub-navigation it served is gone. The rule
 * now, stated by the owner and applied everywhere: IF SOMETHING NEEDS CHILDREN
 * IT IS EITHER ITS OWN SCREEN OR IT DOES NOT BELONG IN NAVIGATION.
 *
 * What that removed, concretely. Five `/search?type=` rows that were one screen
 * with a query parameter changed. Three feed rows, the first of which pointed
 * at its own parent's href. Three profile rows for a destination that is
 * already a row at the top of the rail. An agent listings parent whose two
 * children were the list and the button on the list. An earnings parent whose
 * child was the chart on the earnings page.
 *
 * A person should not have to open a thing to find out whether what they want
 * is inside it. Every row here goes somewhere, immediately, and there is
 * nothing to discover.
 *
 * `NavNode` is still exported by `nav-model` and `children` is still on the
 * type. This file ignores it. Left in place rather than deleted because
 * removing a field from a shared type mid-wave changes two other files that are
 * not this one's to change; nothing constructs it any more.
