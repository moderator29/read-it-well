 * The filter sheet's BODY, to the right-hand panel of 3EB3E2A9. Its trigger is
 * `FilterDrawer`, which loads this module only when the sheet is wanted (see
 * `lib/ui/lazy-sheet.ts`), so none of it is in the first load of /search.
 *
 * Property type as a row of tiles, the market as Buy and Rent, the price
 * range on the two-handled slider, Bedrooms and Bathrooms as Any 1+ 2+ 3+
 * 4+, the amenities as switches, then the location and sort rows and the
 * Reset and Apply pair with the live count on Apply.
 *
 * THE POOL LOGIC IS UNCHANGED. Every option is offered only where the pool
 * (the whole catalogue for the current text) can answer it, and the count on
 * Apply is computed in the browser from the same `matchesFacts` the server
 * uses, so the number a person presses is the number they get.
