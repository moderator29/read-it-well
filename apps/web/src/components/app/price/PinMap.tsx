/**
 * RUNG FOUR OF THE LADDER: A MAP, NOT A TEXT FIELD.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY A PIN AT ALL.
 *
 * There is no geocoder in this tree. `lib/maps/tiles.ts` is a tile licensing
 * module and it is the whole of `lib/maps`. A geocoder for Nigeria is a
 * licensing decision, a cost and a dependency, and it would be wrong more
 * often than a person dragging a pin. More to the point, many Nigerian
 * properties have no formal address at all, so a field demanding one refuses
 * those people and a parser guessing at one invents a building.
 *
 * A pin is more accurate than any Nigerian street address, it needs no parser,
 * it needs no normaliser, and it is the exact input `ST_DWithin` wants.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PIN DOES NOT MOVE. THE MAP DOES.
 *
 * The marker is a div fixed at the centre of the frame and the map pans under
 * it, which is the pattern every ride-hailing and delivery application in
 * Nigeria uses, and it is better than a draggable marker for two reasons that
 * are both about a thumb. A draggable marker on a phone is under the finger
 * that is dragging it, so the thing being placed is the thing being hidden.
 * And a marker has a hit area of about forty pixels while the map has the
 * whole frame, so a centre pin turns a fiddly drag into an ordinary pan.
 *
 * `MapCanvas.tsx` projects its marks onto the frame every frame for the
 * discovery map, for reasons its own header gives. This surface has ONE mark
 * and it never moves relative to the frame, so it needs none of that: the pin
 * is a static element and the coordinate is read off the map's centre.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AND IT WORKS WITH NO TILES AT ALL.
 *
 * If the tile engine or the tile servers cannot be reached, the frame says so
 * and the rest of the screen keeps working, because the pin is a COORDINATE
 * and not a picture. A grey void with a marker floating in it would be worse
 * than a sentence: the reader would not know whether the pin was anywhere.
