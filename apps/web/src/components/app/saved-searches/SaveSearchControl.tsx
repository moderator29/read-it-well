/**
 * SAVE THIS SEARCH, ON THE SEARCH ITSELF.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IT WRITES THE FILTERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN EFFECT.
 *
 * `params` is the canonical form of the address the reader is looking at,
 * built on the server by `canonicalSearch` from the same parsed query the
 * results below were fetched with. Not the raw address bar, which can carry
 * rubbish; not a snapshot taken when the page loaded, which a filter change
 * would leave stale, because changing a filter is a navigation in this product
 * and the server renders this control again with the new parameters.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AND IT READS THE STORED STATE BACK.
 *
 * `saved` is the row the server found for this exact search, under the
 * account's own policy, in this request. That is the half a saved-search
 * feature usually drops: the control says Saved after a RELOAD because a row
 * exists, not because a tap set some state a minute ago. Nothing here writes
 * to the device, and nothing is remembered between renders.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SIGNED OUT IT IS A LINK, NOT A REFUSAL. A saved search has to belong to an
 * account: it follows a person between devices and it is what the alert is
 * addressed to, and there is no honest local half of it the way there is for
 * a hearted listing. So the control is a link to sign in that comes straight
 * back to this same search, rather than a button that takes a tap and then
 * explains why it could not keep it.
