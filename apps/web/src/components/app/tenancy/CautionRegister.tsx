/**
 * M2: THE CAUTION REGISTER, AS A DOCUMENTED EXCHANGE (north star 10 D:
 * "register, deductions, returns, a dispute as a documented exchange").
 *
 * The register is a record two people rely on months after move-out, so it
 * is drawn as a document on the member's own theme (D28.1): the caution and
 * the date it is owed back by, what has been returned, deducted and is still
 * owed, then one thread per deduction and per return, each entry saying who
 * said what, in order. The sheet is not the page's printable one (the money
 * receipt above is), so it carries no print mark.
 *
 * WHAT IT GUARANTEES, from `caution-exchange.ts`: both parties see the same
 * entries (the exchange never takes the viewer), and no ruling appears
 * before Vallo staff make it (a disputed line ends on "waiting for Vallo
 * staff to rule", with no figure). Every figure is the tenancy read's own,
 * formatted there through formatMoney; every sentence about the money is
 * the one this section already used (afterTheGate.tenancy).
 *
 * THE STATE sits above the paper as a StatusChip (word, shape, colour),
 * in the member's theme. Inside the paper each entry's mark speaks the same
 * shape grammar in the paper's own inks.
 *
 * THE CONTROLS (answer, contest, propose, record, escalate) are the page's
 * own, passed as `children` and drawn under the sheet in the member's theme,
 * never on the paper: the document is what was said, the controls are how
 * the reader says the next thing.
