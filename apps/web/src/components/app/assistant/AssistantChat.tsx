/**
 * Vallo AI, to its governing image (`docs/design/references/BF49B814`).
 *
 * The header pair under the chrome (the name and "Always here. Ask
 * anything."), the thread as bubbles (mine brand blue on the right with the
 * time and the ticks, the assistant's glass on the left with the concierge
 * object beside it), the real catalogue results as two-up cards inside the
 * thread, the thinking pill while the model works, the suggestion chips on a
 * rail above the composer, and the composer with the sparkle in its well.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL, because every control on this screen does its thing:
 *
 *   Replies stream live from /api/assistant: text lands token by token in
 *   the bubble, and when the concierge searches the catalogue the results
 *   render as cards linking to the listing, each with a working save.
 *   The chips send their question. The ticks appear on a message once the
 *   assistant has answered it. The settings button opens the real settings
 *   sheet (reply style, language, clear history). The history button opens
 *   the drawer of past conversations, which live under `nf_ai_threads` on
 *   this device. Sending again or leaving the page aborts any in-flight
 *   stream. Signed in, the server returns a durable conversation id, kept on
 *   the thread as `serverId` so future turns append to the same row.
 *
 * THE CARDS CARRY ONLY WHAT THE ROUTE STREAMS. The wire type now carries the
 * facts the render shows (the Verified mark, beds, baths and floor area),
 * each read off the repository row and omitted when the lister stated
 * nothing, so a card here draws exactly what the search page's card draws
 * for the same listing and never a picture of a fact.
 *
 * The chrome strings (the name pair, the prompts, the composer's placeholder,
 * the thinking word) come from `home.assistant` in the dictionary, so the
 * three other languages reach them.

/*
 * THE OPENING PROMPTS, AND WHY THESE.
 *
 * Each asks what this platform, specifically, can answer: a real budget in
 * the unit rent is actually quoted in, the move-in total it computes, the
 * power columns no competitor carries, and the shortlet market. A starter
 * that cannot be answered teaches somebody the assistant does not work, so
 * nothing here is a mood the catalogue has no inventory for.
 *
 * THE LAST TWO ARE THE OTHER SIDE, and they are here because all four of the
 * originals were property (ledger 10.4). Vallo is two sides, and an assistant
 * whose every opening line is a rent question tells somebody the Stays half
 * of their own account is not its business. A hotel and a table are both
 * shapes the catalogue actually holds, so both are answerable.

/*
 * WHERE A RESULT OPENS: the SIDE LAW, applied on the card.
 *
 * `lib/side.constants.ts` rules that the URL wins over the cookie, so a hotel
 * link opens in the Stays shell for everybody and a flat opens in Property.
 * The assistant route streams every result with `href` hardcoded to
 * `/listing/<id>` regardless of what the row is, so until now a hotel the
 * assistant found opened inside the property shell: property dock, property
 * chrome, a Book Inspection footer under a room that is sold by the night.
 *
 * `/api/assistant` now builds the right path through `hrefForListing`, so
 * fresh results arrive correct. THIS STAYS ANYWAY, because conversations live
 * on the device under `nf_ai_threads` and every result card stored before
 * that fix carries the old `/listing/<id>` in its own JSON. Without this a
 * person's own history would keep opening hotels in the property shell for as
 * long as they kept the thread. The wire carries `kind`, so the right
 * destination is recomputed from a stale row rather than migrated.
 *
 * The same `hrefForListing` the route uses, so there is one rule and not a
 * second one wearing a client's clothes. The wire types `kind` as `string`
 * because it is the column value, and `hrefForListing` answers `/listing/<id>`
 * for anything it does not recognise, which is the same thing the stale row
 * already said.
