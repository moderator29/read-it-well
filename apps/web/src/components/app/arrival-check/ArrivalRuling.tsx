/**
 * V-91, in the console: uphold or decline an arrival report, once. A ruling
 * cannot be undone, so each asks for a confirmation that says what it does to
 * the payout pause; a ruling the database refused ("none") says so.
 *
 * THE CONFIRMATION IS A SLIDE (Session 3, W13; COMPONENT_LIBRARY: "an admin
 * ruling on a dispute"). A ruling holds or releases a host's payout and can
 * never be taken back, which is exactly the friction `DragToConfirm` exists
 * for: a tap on the wrong one of two side-by-side buttons at 2am is the
 * mistake this removes. It is marked `money`, because the ruling decides
 * whether money moves, so the control never springs back to looking
 * unconfirmed once the server has accepted it, and it says "confirmed" only
 * after `ruleArrivalCheck` has resolved. The keyboard path is the handle
 * itself (Enter or Space), so nothing here needs a pointer.
