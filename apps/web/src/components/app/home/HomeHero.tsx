/**
 * The hero container, to `GOVERNING-01` screen one and `GOVERNING-09` screen
 * one. One component, because the two sides draw the SAME OBJECT with
 * different content and the moment they are two components they drift.
 *
 * The anatomy, top to bottom, exactly as both renders draw it:
 *
 *   a photographed plate filling the container, corners rounded on the card
 *   rung and the whole thing lit at the top rim;
 *   the PLACE CHIP over the photograph, top left, with its pin;
 *   the headline in heavy display type, two lines on a phone;
 *   one supporting line;
 *   and THE SEARCH FIELD INSIDE THE CONTAINER, with a filter control in its
 *   right end.
 *
 * WHAT THE RENDERS PUT ABOVE THIS AND WHAT SHIPS ABOVE IT ARE DIFFERENT, on
 * the founder's instruction. `GOVERNING-09` drops the greeting and the
 * location selector for a bare place chip; both sides keep them, because they
 * are the reader's own facts and they are the one thing on this screen that
 * cannot be a marketing line. The chip inside the container is in addition to
 * the selector above it, not instead of it: the selector is the control that
 * CHANGES the place, the chip says which place the plate is showing.
 *
 * THE FIELD IS A REAL FORM AND A REAL GET. It writes `?q=` into the address
 * bar of the search screen, which is the whole discovery contract in
 * `lib/listings/search-params.ts`, so a hunt begun here is a link like any
 * other. It needs no JavaScript to work.
 *
 * THE PHOTOGRAPH IS `MediaFrame`'s, which is `next/image` with a `sizes` of
 * the full viewport and `priority`, because this is the first thing above the
 * fold. Nothing is hardcoded as a background image: the stop list forbids
 * shipping an image asset that has not been through the optimiser.
