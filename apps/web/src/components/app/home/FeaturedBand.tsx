/**
 * The featured band, to `GOVERNING-01` screen one and `GOVERNING-09` screen
 * one: a heading with a quiet "See all" on its right, and beneath it a row of
 * cards that scrolls SIDEWAYS rather than a grid that stacks.
 *
 * THE ROW SCROLLS AND THE CARDS DO NOT SHRINK. Both renders draw the second
 * card cut off at the right edge, which is the affordance: it says there are
 * more without spending a control on saying so. That is one CSS decision (a
 * fixed card width plus horizontal scroll with snap) and it is in
 * `.nf-feature-row`, not here.
 *
 * IT TAKES CHILDREN RATHER THAN ROWS. The property side hands it
 * `ListingCard`s and the Stays side hands it `StayCard`s, and both of those
 * are shared cards owned elsewhere that must never be forked to appear here.
 * This component owns the BAND: the heading, the link, the scroller and the
 * empty state. It owns no card.
 *
 * NOTHING IS PRINTED WHEN THE DATABASE RETURNS NOTHING. The roles README's
 * seventh translation rule: every count and price in the renders is example
 * content. An empty shelf renders the caller's own empty state, never a
 * placeholder card.
