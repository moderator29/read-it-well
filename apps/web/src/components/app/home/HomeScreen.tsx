/**
 * The property home page, to `GOVERNING-01` SCREEN ONE.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT WAS KEPT, WHAT WAS REPLACED, AND WHY EACH.
 *
 * KEPT, on the founder's instruction, because they are the reader's own facts
 * and the one thing on this screen that cannot be a marketing line: the
 * greeting decided by the clock in Lagos, their name, and the location
 * selector. The header above (hamburger, lockup, bell, avatar) is the shell's
 * and is untouched.
 *
 * REPLACED, and this is everything below the selector:
 *
 *   1. THE HERO CONTAINER. A photographed property plate carrying the place
 *      chip, "Find your next home" in heavy type, one supporting line, and THE
 *      SEARCH FIELD INSIDE THE CONTAINER with a filter control in its right
 *      end. This takes the place of the bare wide search well that stood here.
 *   2. THE FOUR CATEGORY TILES: Buy, Rent, Manage, Invest. Four, not the
 *      render's five: "Short Let" is the Stays side and does not ship here.
 *      Not nine: `MarketTiles` drew nine markets with counts, and both the
 *      render and rule 15 say a tile carries a name rather than a figure.
 *   3. FEATURED PROPERTIES, with a "See all", as a row of cards that scrolls
 *      sideways.
 *
 * FIVE BLOCKS CAME OFF THIS SCREEN AND NONE OF THEM BECAME UNREACHABLE, which
 * is the same standard the dock's "More" slot was held to. `MarketTiles` ->
 * the four tiles and `/search?type=`. `InvestBand` -> the Invest tile, which
 * is that band's own destination. `FeaturedCities` -> `/search` and the
 * location selector kept above. `TrendingStrip` -> the Feed slot in the dock.
 * `AiAssistantBanner` -> `/assistant`, which is a row in the side drawer and
 * always was. The agents card -> `/agents`, also a drawer row, and the switch
 * in the centre of the dock, which is now the real door to supply. Every one
 * of the six is listed in `docs/archive/BUILD_07_LEDGER.md` section 6 with
 * its new home.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TWO CATEGORIES THAT NEEDED A RULING AND HAVE ONE.
 *
 * INVEST is a BROWSE FILTER over properties presented for their yield, and
 * nothing else. Never a financial product, never a fund, never a promise of
 * return. The Invest segment was taken out of the landing search control once
 * already and the comment at the top of `SearchPill.tsx` records why: Vallo
 * sells no investment product. That ruling stands and this tile does not
 * reopen it, because a tile that filters the catalogue is not an instrument.
 * The supporting line under it says so in the product, not only here.
 *
 * MANAGE RESOLVES BY WHO IS ASKING. Somebody who holds a supplier workspace
 * lands on their own properties; somebody who holds none lands on the "Add a
 * workspace" chooser, which is `GOVERNING-02`. It needs no new product and it
 * is honest in both states. The page decides which and hands the href in, so
 * this component never has to know about roles.
 *
 * PURE. The route reads the overview, the listings and the role facts and
 * hands them in; the preview harness hands in fixtures, so the look proven in
 * the harness is the look that ships.

  /*
   * THE PARAMETER IS `market`, AND IT IS NOT THE ONE THE OLD TILES SPENT.
   *
   * `MarketTiles` linked at `/search?intent=rent` and `/search?intent=sale`.
   * `parseShelfQuery` reads `market=buy|rent` and reads NOTHING called
   * `intent`, so both of those tiles landed on the unfiltered catalogue from
   * the day the market parameter was introduced: somebody tapping Buy saw
   * rentals mixed into the results.
   *
   * FIXED, and the count is smaller than it first looked. Only TWO tiles were
   * wrong, not the row: the other seven spell `type`, and `parseDiscoveryQuery`
   * does read `type` through `parseKind`, with every one of their six values
   * present in `KIND_NOUN`. The dead spelling survived in exactly three links,
   * these two and the Invest band's call to action, and all three now spend
   * `market`.
   *
   * BUY AND INVEST REACH THE SAME SHELF TODAY, ON PURPOSE AND SAID OUT LOUD.
   * Invest is a browse filter over properties presented for their yield, and
   * this platform holds no yield fact to filter on: no rental income, no
   * service charge history, no occupancy. So Invest is the for-sale market
   * with its own framing, which is exactly what `InvestBand` already resolved
   * it to and for the same stated reason. It narrows the day there is
   * something honest to narrow on, and until then the supporting line under
   * the tile says what it is and what it is not.

  /*
   * FOUR OBJECTS THAT BEHAVE THE SAME WAY IN DAYLIGHT, AND THEY DID NOT.
   *
   * Buy was `keys-handover`, which is one of the 23 transaction marks that
   * ship with their own LIGHT TWIN. So in light it drew a pale frosted object
   * with no navy chip while Rent, Manage and Invest, which have no twin, kept
   * the navy chip: one tile from one family standing beside three from
   * another, in a row whose whole job is to read as a set. Measured at 390 in
   * light on a production server. `home-check` is not twinned, which is what
   * `MarketTiles` already used for this market, so all four now take the navy
   * chip in daylight and all four are lit glass at night.
   *
   * The general rule, worth more than this row: a set of objects drawn side by
   * side must be all twinned or none, because the twin set is a property of
   * the ARTWORK and no call site can see it.
   */
  /*
   * FOUR DOORS, ONE WORD EACH: Buy, Rent, Pay, List (the founder, 25
   * September 2026). Pay opens Agreements, which is where a payment is made:
   * it opens there once both sides have confirmed the agreement and Vallo has
   * approved it, so the tile says the one word and promises nothing more.
   * Every object is a whole glass object; `manage-ring`, a faint ring around a
   * line glyph, read as nothing on a phone, and List now carries the page
