 * screen does not draw a button that the database would refuse: it says which
 * step the agreement is at and takes the person to it.
 *
 * D72: the same sentence and the same link, drawn as reference 2's path
 * (agree, review, pay) so a member sees where the deal is at a glance. The
 * path only shows the status it is given; it never decides when payment
 * opens, which stays the agreement's approval and nothing else.
