/**
 * THE MAIN TABS FETCHED AHEAD, AND THE SCREEN KEPT CURRENT (13 October 2026,
 * the startup track). Renders nothing. `lib/nav/tab-warm.ts` says why.
 *
 *   - When the browser is idle after a page lands, each main tab whose copy
 *     is not fresh is fetched whole (`router.prefetch`, the same request the
 *     dock's own links make), Messages included, so a tap draws the tab at
 *     once instead of its skeleton. The router joins a request already on its
 *     way and skips a copy it already holds.
 *   - When the app comes back to the foreground, the same, at once, because
 *     every copy may have aged out while it was away; and the screen on
 *     display, if the app was away REFRESH_AFTER_AWAY_MS or more, refreshes
 *     itself in place inside a transition: the last screen stays up while it
 *     refreshes, never a skeleton.
 *   - On the first touch after a copy has aged out (somebody reading one
 *     screen for ten minutes), the same, so the copies are fresh again by the
 *     time the thumb reaches the dock.
 *   - A server action that changes something tells the router, which tells
 *     this (`onInvalidate`), and that tab is fetched again.
 *
 * NEVER UNDER DATA SAVING (`isDataSaver`), the same rule as every other
 * fetch ahead on this platform, and never in development, where the router
 * prefetches nothing either. Behind the passcode lock the screen is not
 * refreshed: unlocking refreshes the route itself.
