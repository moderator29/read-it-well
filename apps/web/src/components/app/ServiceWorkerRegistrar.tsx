/**
 * Registers the service worker that keeps Vallo working with a weak signal or
 * none, and tells it which pages were opened.
 *
 * Four deliberate constraints on the registration:
 *
 *   - Production only. A worker in development caches build output that
 *     changes on every keystroke and produces phantom stale bugs.
 *   - After the window load event, so registration never competes with first
 *     paint on a mid-range Android. The shell precache is a background errand,
 *     not part of getting the page up.
 *   - Feature detected. No serviceWorker in navigator (older Android
 *     browsers, or any private-mode restriction) means simply no worker, with
 *     nothing else different about the app.
 *   - Silent on failure. A worker is an enhancement. If registration is
 *     refused, the site must behave exactly as it did before it existed, so
 *     nothing is thrown and nothing is shown to the user.
 *
 * THE VISITS (8 October 2026). A tap inside the app is a data fetch, not a
 * page load, so the worker never sees the page it opened and could not keep
 * it for offline. So every page this component sees opened is announced to
 * the worker a moment after it lands (`lib/offline/page-cache.ts`), once the
 * navigation's own requests are done; the worker decides whether to keep it.
 * The first page is announced again when the worker takes control, because
 * on a first visit it loaded before there was a worker to see it.
 *
 * NOT WHILE SAVING DATA. Keeping a page opened inside the app costs one more
 * download of it, so nothing is announced when the person turned data saving
 * on in Settings, or their phone says Save-Data or 2g (`isDataSaver`). The
 * worker checks the phone's own signal again. Pages opened by a full load
 * are kept either way, because that costs nothing extra.
 *
 * Renders nothing.
