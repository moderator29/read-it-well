/**
 * Get started IN MOTION (30 September), to the founder's onboarding video
 * (`docs/design/references/2026-09-29/51` to `53`) inside the full-page steps
 * of `42` and `43`.
 *
 * THE ONE ONBOARDING (the founder, 7 October 2026: "I'm seeing 2 different
 * types... Keep THESE ones"). This carousel is the only get-started there is:
 * the four-card intro that used to open a cold start (`WelcomeIntro`,
 * `get-started.css`) is retired, and every way in (Sign in, Sign up, Get
 * started, the app's first open, an invite link) reaches this, once per
 * device, then goes straight to the page it asked for.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF A STEP, top to bottom:
 *
 *   back (steps two on), the Vallo lockup, Skip
 *   the progress bar, one segment per step, filling as you go
 *   the SCENE: the founder's clay art for the step in a rounded card, with
 *     chips in our components' style arriving over it one after another and
 *     then floating gently (`OnboardingScenes.tsx`)
 *   a big two-line title and the body, arriving after the scene
 *   one full-width pill: Continue, and on the last step the real call
 *
 * On a wide screen the scene takes the left and the words and the pill the
 * right. The rules (which step a key or a swipe lands on, what Skip does,
 * what moves under each motion setting) are pure functions in
 * `onboarding-flow.ts`, tested on their own.
 *
 *   1. Homes. Stays. Restaurants. Homes and Stays over the home and hotel.
 *   2. Know who you deal with.    The shield and the ID under a scan frame,
 *                                 the Verified agent badge and the Record.
 *   3. Talk first. Pay when sure. A question, then an Example Pay on Vallo.
 *   4. The ending.                The keys and an Example move-in total. A
 *                                 stranger: Create account (or Sign in).
 *                                 Somebody signed in: one Continue into the
 *                                 app, through the interests question only
 *                                 while it is unanswered.
 *
 * MOTION. A step change slides the scenes sideways and crossfades them
 * (transform and opacity only, `app/welcome/onboarding-motion.css`); a drag
 * moves them with the finger. Reduced motion, Calm and Off: every step lands
 * at once, nothing staggers, floats or counts. A still background (Living
 * backgrounds off, data saver) keeps the arrivals and drops the float.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CONTROL WRITES, because a first run with painted buttons is a
 * picture of onboarding:
 *
 *   Continue            moves one step on. Reaching the last step records
 *                       this device as shown (`rememberFirstRunSeen`).
 *   Skip, a stranger    records the device, then carries on to where they
 *                       were going (`?next=`), or lands on the ending.
 *   Skip, a member      records the opener on the profile AND skips the
 *                       question (`markWelcomeSeen` + `skipInterests`, the
 *                       real skip that never asks again), then home.
 *   Continue, a member  `onDone`: records the opener on the profile, then the
 *   (last step)         interests question if it is still unasked, else home.
 *   The two doors       real links to `/sign-up` and `/sign-in`, keeping the
 *                       address the person asked for.
 *   Back                every step is a history entry, so the drawn back
 *                       button, the browser's back and Android's hardware
 *                       back all step to the previous step; from step one
 *                       back leaves as it came.
 *
 * Swipe, the arrow keys (Home and End too) and the progress segments all move
 * between steps; every change is announced in a polite live region and the
 * new step's title takes focus when the change came from inside the flow.
 * Only the step on screen is in the accessibility tree.
