 * mapping to this one forever, and a mapping nobody owns is how two vocabularies
 * drift apart until the stated intent stops meaning anything the catalogue can
 * answer.
 *
 * `Constants` is generated from the database, so this list cannot fall behind
 * the enum: add a value in Postgres, regenerate, and the option appears here,
 * in the validator and on the screen at once. The only thing hand-written is
 * the label, because a database value is not a sentence.
