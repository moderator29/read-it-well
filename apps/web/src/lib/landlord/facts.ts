 * can the code prove this sentence? When it cannot, the answer is null and the
 * screen draws nothing. There is no "not confirmed", no grey cross and no
 * "waiting for the owner" on a listing: a landlord who has not answered yet
 * has said nothing, and saying nothing is not a negative until the 21 days in
 * `private.sweep_not_reconfirmed` have passed.
 *
 * `availability_confirmed_at` is written only by the principal's own answer,
 * from their own number or their own single-use link, so "Owner confirmed
 * available" is a sentence the database proves. It is shown for 45 days and
 * then dropped rather than aged forever: a confirmation that old says less than
 * the fortnightly question that has been asked since, and the sweep, not a
 * stale line, is what speaks for silence.
