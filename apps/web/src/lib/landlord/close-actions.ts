/**
 * V-48. A LISTER CLOSES A RENTAL WITH A REASON.
 *
 * One call to `public.close_listing`, which checks the caller holds the
 * listing, that it is a live or approved rental, and, for "Let through Vallo",
 * that a rent charge on it was actually paid. A let through Vallo closes every
 * copy of the same property in the same transaction, because the payment proves
 * it. Any other reason closes this copy only, since one lister's word never
 * takes a rival's listing down; after "Let elsewhere" the other copies' listers
 * are told and their own principals are asked, within the weekly limit.
 * Nothing here decides any of that; this is the door.
 *
 * The workspace draws this in place of "Take down" on a live rental.
 * `unpublishListing` in `lib/agent/listings-actions.ts` still exists and still
 * works: making the close the ONLY unpublish path for a rental means changing
 * the listings transition rule, which the audit session holds, so that half is
 * reported to it rather than changed here.
