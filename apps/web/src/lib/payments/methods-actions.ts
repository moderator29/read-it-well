/**
 * Saved cards: list, choose a default, remove, and start saving one.
 *
 * Every read and every owner write runs under the caller's own RLS-bound
 * client. The database has no insert policy on payment_methods for anybody
 * but the service role, and the column grant limits an owner's UPDATE to
 * is_default and deleted_at, so nothing here could file a card or rewrite a
 * token even if it tried. Removing a card is a soft delete: the row that was
 * charged last month is still the row support answers questions about.
 *
 * Saving a card is a NGN 100 check charge. Paystack only hands out a
 * reusable authorization after a successful charge, so the checkout charges
 * the smallest honest amount under an `rm-fund-` reference. There is no wallet
 * any more (Track A): the webhook refunds every `rm-fund-` charge to the card
 * in full, and nothing is credited anywhere. The card itself is filed by
 * `confirmCardSetup` below, once Paystack's verify says the check succeeded
 * for this person at exactly NGN 100 (B-6; the rules are in `card-setup.ts`).
