/**
 * THE RAIL ROUTER, server side (Session 2, 7.4; architecture 3A.3).
 *
 * The routing lives in `public.payment_rail_policy` as dated data and is
 * resolved by `public.resolve_payment_rail` (migration 20261006030027):
 * highest precedence, then most specific, wins; no match or a disagreeing tie
 * is NO RAIL. This module never decides a rail itself and never falls back:
 * anything but `resolved` means no payment opens.
 *
 * Called by every path that opens a card payment (`split-attempt.ts`
 * quoteSplit, which the hosted checkout and the saved-card charge share), and
 * the answer is written into `transactions.rail` and `rail_policy_id` at
 * insert, fixed by trigger thereafter.
 *
 * THE ESCROW GATE (`railGate`). A payment the policy sends to escrow is
 * REFUSED on every direct (card) path, never opened on the direct rail
 * instead, because a direct Paystack split settles the lister at the moment
 * of charge and the hold the policy promised would silently not exist. An
 * escrow payment opens only on the escrow path (`lib/money/fund-actions.ts`).
 *
 * THE PAYER'S CHOICE (founder ruling 2, 13 October 2026). On a rent or a
 * shortlet the payer picks escrow (the default) or card
 * (`lib/payments/rail-choice.ts`); the database applies the choice
 * (`private.rail_for_booking`), and `railForBooking` reads that answer.
