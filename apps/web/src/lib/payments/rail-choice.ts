/**
 * THE PAYER'S CHOICE OF RAIL (founder ruling 2, 13 October 2026).
 *
 * Every payment for a deal happens inside Vallo, and Vallo never holds the
 * money: a licensed partner holds an escrow payment, a card payment is split
 * by the processor straight to the lister's account.
 *
 *   rent, shortlet   the payer picks: Escrow (preselected, recommended) or
 *                    Pay by card
 *   sale             escrow only
 *   hotel room       card only, at the price shown
 *   restaurant       card only (and bill payment stays off)
 *
 * The database decides what may be picked and applies the choice
 * (`public.payment_rail_options`, `public.payment_rail_choose`, pending
 * migration pov04); this module only reads its answer, fail closed, and says
 * what the payment step draws. Pure and client-safe.
