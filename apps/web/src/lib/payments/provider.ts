/**
 * THE FIAT PROVIDER SEAM (Session 2, 7.3).
 *
 * Modelled on the crypto seam (`lib/crypto/provider.ts`), with one difference
 * that is the whole point: the fiat providers are not equivalent. Paystack
 * splits at the moment of charge and cannot hold money; Payluk holds money in
 * escrow, cannot split, and cannot refund without a dispute. So every
 * provider shares a small CORE, and everything else is a CAPABILITY whose
 * methods exist on the type only when it is declared:
 *
 *   - `defineFiatProvider(["split_at_charge", ...], impl)` builds the runtime
 *     set from the same literal list as the type, so the two cannot drift, and
 *     an adapter missing a declared capability's methods does not compile.
 *   - `can(p, "hold_in_escrow")` is a type predicate: inside the `if`, the
 *     escrow methods are on `p`; outside, they are not.
 *
 * Always true, for every provider:
 *  - The reference is Vallo's, generated before the call, and it is the
 *    idempotency key whatever the provider offers (Payluk offers none, so its
 *    adapter must look a reference up before creating).
 *  - Webhook signatures are checked over the RAW body, constant-time.
 *  - A timeout is UNKNOWN, never a failure. Never retry a money-moving call
 *    blindly; read back first.
 *  - Secrets live in the server environment only.
 *
 * This file is types and pure functions only, safe to import anywhere.
