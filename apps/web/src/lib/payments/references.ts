/**
 * The payment reference contract, in one place.
 *
 * A reference is not a cosmetic prefix. It is the key money moves on: the
 * wallet ledger's `reference` column is unique, `transactions.provider_ref` is
 * unique, and the Paystack webhook routes purely on these shapes. That is what
 * makes a replayed delivery collide with itself instead of posting twice. Never
 * invent a new shape without adding it here and teaching
 * app/api/paystack/webhook/route.ts to route it.
 *
 * The whole family this platform generates:
 *
 *  - `rm-fund-<uuid>`  Wallet funding. A hosted Paystack charge, settled by
 *    charge.success, which posts a COMPLETED deposit to wallet_entries. The
 *    verify-on-redirect fallback posts the identical row, so whichever arrives
 *    first wins and the second is a clean duplicate.
 *
 *  - `rm-wd-<uuid>`  Withdrawal. Posted first as a PENDING debit hold, then
 *    handed to Paystack as a transfer under the same reference;
 *    transfer.success / transfer.failed / transfer.reversed settle that one
 *    hold and nothing else.
 *
 *  - `rm-p2p-<uuid>-out` / `rm-p2p-<uuid>-in`  The paired legs of an internal
 *    transfer, written inside one database function so both land or neither.
 *
 *  - `rm-book-<uuid>`  A card payment against a booking. Written first as a
 *    PENDING `transactions` row whose `provider_ref` is the reference, then
 *    handed to Paystack. charge.success settles it (transaction to SUCCESSFUL,
 *    one balanced `ledger_entries` row, booking PENDING to CONFIRMED, state
 *    event, calendar nights) and charge.failed marks the transaction FAILED
 *    while leaving the booking PENDING so the guest can try again. The same
 *    shape carries a wallet payment: there it keys both the `payment` debit in
 *    wallet_entries and the `transactions` row written inside one atomic
 *    database function, so paying a booking from the wallet is idempotent on
 *    exactly the same key as paying it by card.
 *
 *  - `rm-refund-<uuid>`  Money going back to a guest after RentMe support
 *    cancels a stay they had paid for. Posted as a COMPLETED `refund` credit
 *    inside private.refund_and_cancel_booking, in the same transaction as the
 *    contra ledger row, the booking transition and the calendar release. The
 *    unique reference is what makes a double tap on the console a no-op rather
 *    than a second payment out. Nothing hands this shape to Paystack: the money
 *    lands in the RentMe wallet, exactly as /cancellations promises, and leaves
 *    it later as an ordinary withdrawal under `rm-wd-`.
 *
 *  - `rm-esc-<escrow uuid>-hold` / `-release` / `-refund`  Escrow. Three legs,
 *    one escrow agreement, all three in the SAME ledger everything else is in
 *    (`public.wallet_entries`, kinds `escrow_hold`, `escrow_release`,
 *    `escrow_refund`). There is no second table of escrow balances anywhere:
 *    a shadow ledger is how a marketplace ends up unable to answer "how much
 *    does this person have" with one number.
 *
 *    The uuid in the middle is the ESCROW ROW's id, not a fresh one. That is
 *    deliberate and it is the whole idempotency story: a retried release
 *    computes the identical reference, collides with the unique index on
 *    wallet_entries.reference, and moves nothing. A random uuid per attempt
 *    would make every retry a second payment. Each escrow therefore has at most
 *    one hold, and at most one of release or refund; a partial settlement is a
 *    new escrow row, not a fourth leg on this one.
 *
 * The platform charges nothing, so a booking reference always moves the
 * booking total and nothing more (docs/MASTER_TODO.md section 5b).
