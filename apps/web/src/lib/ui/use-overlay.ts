/**
 * The four things every overlay owes the person using it.
 *
 * A sweep across all twenty-two overlays in this app found the same three
 * defects distributed almost at random: `AppShell`'s drawer and the site
 * `MobileMenu` carried `aria-modal` and no Escape handler at all, four sheets
 * let the page scroll behind them, and NOT ONE of the twenty-two trapped Tab.
 * Every one of them had been written by hand, which is why no two agreed.
 *
 * So this is one implementation, and the contract is:
 *
 *  1. **Escape closes.** An overlay a keyboard cannot leave is a trap.
 *  2. **The body does not scroll behind it.** The most common mobile bug in
 *     the world: you flick to dismiss a sheet and the page underneath moves.
 *     On iOS Safari that needs the body pinned, not only `overflow: hidden`
 *     (`lockBody`).
 *  3. **Tab stays inside.** Tabbing out of a modal into the page behind it
 *     leaves a screen reader reading content that is visually covered.
 *  4. **Focus comes back.** On close, focus returns to whatever opened the
 *     overlay, so the keyboard does not get dumped at the top of the document.
 *
 * NOT EVERY OVERLAY IS MODAL. A navigation menu that opens over the page and
 * does not hide it (`InnerNav`) must not lock the body, must not trap Tab and
 * must not pull focus away from where the person is. It passes `modal: false`
 * and keeps the two things that are still owed: Escape closes it (when focus
 * is inside it, or the Escape is Android Back's synthetic one), and it joins
 * the overlay registry, so the Android back button closes it too (a non-locking
 * overlay leaves no scroll lock for Back to find, which is why Back asks the
 * registry and not the lock). It makes no history entry, so the BROWSER's back
 * button is not part of this; that needs `use-sheet-history.ts`, deliberately
 * not used for a menu. A modal overlay (the default) behaves exactly as it
 * always has.
 *
 * The scroll lock counts openers rather than setting and clearing a flag,
 * because two overlays can legitimately be open at once (a sheet over a
 * drawer) and the naive version has the inner one restore scrolling when it
 * closes while the outer is still up.

 * is ignored by iOS Safari: the page behind a sheet still scrolls under a
 * finger, which is the bug this hook exists to prevent, and every sheet
 * inherited it. So the body is also pinned in place: `position: fixed` at
 * `top: -scrollY`, full width, which iOS does honour, and the page stays
 * exactly where it was on screen. The last release unpins it and scrolls the
 * window back to the same place, so closing a sheet never jumps the page to
 * the top. Where the page had a classic scrollbar, its width is padded back
 * so the content does not shift sideways when it disappears.
