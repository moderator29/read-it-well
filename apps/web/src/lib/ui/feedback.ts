/**
 * ONE FEEDBACK GRAMMAR, AND HAPTICS THAT EXIST ON AN IPHONE. V-30.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT WAS WRONG.
 *
 * `components/ui/Button.tsx` called `navigator.vibrate?.(8)` on every press of
 * every primary and danger button. `navigator.vibrate` does not exist in
 * Safari or in WKWebView, so no iPhone has ever felt Vallo. On Android it
 * buzzed identically for "pressed" and for "paid", and it buzzed on the press,
 * before anybody knew whether the action had been accepted: a declined card
 * felt exactly like a settled one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FIVE KINDS AND NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 *   select    a tab, a segment, a chip: a choice was taken
 *   confirm   a primary action was ACCEPTED (not tapped)
 *   success   money settled, an inspection confirmed: a ResultSheet in a good
 *             state
 *   warning   a ResultSheet that is pending or under review
 *   error     a ResultSheet that failed
 *
 * The grammar is the point. A settled payment must feel different from a tap,
 * and a refusal different from both, or the phone is making noise rather than
 * saying something. A sixth kind would need an argument that none of these
 * five says it already.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THREE CHANNELS, CHOSEN IN ORDER.
 *
 *   1. THE NATIVE SHELL, through Capacitor's `Haptics` plugin: impact light
 *      for select, impact medium for confirm, and the system's own
 *      success / warning / error notification patterns, which are what an
 *      iPhone user already knows from Apple Pay.
 *   2. ANDROID WEB, through `navigator.vibrate`, with a distinct pattern per
 *      kind so a success is two beats and an error is three.
 *   3. EVERYWHERE ELSE, NOTHING. iOS Safari has no vibration API; a desktop
 *      has no motor. Silence there is correct, not a fallback.
 *
 * The plugin is reached through `Capacitor.registerPlugin("Haptics")`, the
 * way `components/app/push/enrol.ts` reaches push, and only after
 * `looksNative()` has said this is the shell, so the website never evaluates
 * `@capacitor/core`. If the shell was built without the plugin,
 * `isPluginAvailable` says so and the call falls through to channel 2 (the
 * Android web view has `navigator.vibrate`) or to silence. `@capacitor/haptics`
 * is in `apps/web/package.json` and synced into both shells
 * (`android/capacitor.settings.gradle`, `ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift`;
 * `haptic-census.test.ts` holds all three), so in the app a select is a real
 * light impact, a confirm a medium one, and success and error the system's own
 * notification patterns (on Android, amplitude-shaped waveforms at 250 and 180).
 * Nothing of it reaches the website's bundle: the import below is lazy.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE WEIGHTS (CRAFT_DOCTRINE 6), AND WHERE EACH IS HELD.
 *
 *   select   light: a digit, a chip, a toggle, a tab, a heart
 *   confirm  medium: a primary action accepted, a sheet landing, an unlock
 *   success  heavy: a payoff only (`HEAVY_SITES` and `PAYOFF_MOMENTS`)
 *   error    the one sharp pattern, for a genuine failure
 *   warning  kept in the grammar for the native mapping and the styleguide;
 *            no call site uses it, because there is one error pattern
 *
 * Nothing in a list, a scroll or a passive state vibrates: the census reads
 * every call site and fails on one inside a scroll or move handler, an
 * observer, a timer or a delivery listener.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * REDUCED MOTION TURNS IT DOWN, NOT OFF.
 *
 * Somebody who asked the system for less motion gets success and error only:
 * the two outcomes worth feeling, and nothing for taps, segments or pending.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EACH KIND HAS ONE MOTION TOKEN.
 *
 * `FEEDBACK_MOTION` pairs each kind with the duration and curve it should move
 * with, so what is felt and what is seen agree: the press curve for select
 * and confirm, the spring for success, the press curve for warning and error
 * because a failure should not bounce.
