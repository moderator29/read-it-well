/**
 * The door, counted.
 *
 * Supabase applies its own limits at the auth endpoint, and they are the last
 * line rather than the first: they are shared across the whole project, tuned
 * for its own protection rather than this platform's, and they are not reached
 * at all by an attempt this file refuses on validation. These three actions are
 * the ones worth counting here, because each is reachable with no session and
 * each one costs something real: a sign-in attempt is a password guess, a
 * sign-up writes a row and sends mail, a reset sends mail to an address the
 * request chose.
 *
 * WHY A RESET IS COUNTED BY ADDRESS. It protects the owner of that address
 * from having their inbox used as a weapon, and costs them nothing, because a
 * throttled reset never stops them signing in normally.
 *
 * SIGN-IN IS COUNTED BOTH WAYS, AND THE SECOND COUNT WAS ADDED ON 22 SEPTEMBER
 * 2026 AFTER A MEASUREMENT. This comment used to argue that sign-in must NEVER
 * be counted per address, because anybody who knows somebody's email could
 * spend the allowance on purpose and hold them out of their own account. That
 * argument is correct about a TIGHT per-address limit and it left a hole the
 * per-connection count cannot cover: ten guesses a minute from one place is
 * ten guesses a minute from EACH place, so a botnet had UNLIMITED guesses
 * against any one account on a platform that holds people's wallet balances.
 * Unlimited guessing is the larger of the two harms, and it is the one an
 * attacker can act on without knowing anything about the victim except their
 * address, which they already needed for the denial.
 *
 * So the address ceiling is set where no person can reach it and a guessing
 * run hits it immediately: SIXTY attempts an hour. A person signing in sixty
 * times in an hour from one address does not exist; a stuffing run spends that
 * in seconds. The denial it creates is real and it is bounded to the window,
 * it is recorded as a risk alert the moment it trips so nobody has to guess
 * why somebody cannot get in, and it is smaller than the denial the reset
 * limiter three lines down has always accepted.
 *
 * THIS IS A TRADE AND IT IS THE FOUNDER'S TO REVERSE. Both halves are written
 * out here rather than one of them being quietly chosen, because the previous
 * decision went the other way and a reader deserves to know that.

 *                  the email on a different device.
 *   access/refresh the implicit flow, which puts the tokens in the URL
