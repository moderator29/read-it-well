/**
 * NO ACCOUNT WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT, PROVED BY CALLING THE THING.
 *
 * The defect these replace. Acceptance was enforced in the browser alone:
 * `EmailAuthForm` called `preventDefault()` when the tick was missing,
 * `AcceptTerms` rendered the hidden `termsVersion` only once it was ticked,
 * and the form carries `noValidate`, so there was not even a native
 * `required` behind the JavaScript. A request assembled by hand, or a browser
 * running no script, reached the server action with no version and THE
 * ACCOUNT WAS CREATED, with null recorded where the agreement should be.
 *
 * And the test that was supposed to cover it asserted that
 * `EmailAuthForm.tsx` CONTAINS the string `setAcceptError(true)`. It would
 * have passed with the submit never stopped, with the tick removed from the
 * form, with the server recording nothing. That is a mirror: it reflected the
 * source back at itself and called the reflection evidence.
 *
 * So these assert the OUTCOME. The provider is a spy. If the refusal ever
 * stops happening, `signUp` gets called, and the spy says so.
