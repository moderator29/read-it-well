/**
 * The shape every auth form hands back, in a module of its own.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT MOVED OUT OF `actions.ts`, AND IT IS A RULE RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE.
 *
 * `lib/auth/actions.ts` carries `"use server"`. A `"use server"` module may
 * export async functions and NOTHING ELSE, not even a type re-export: every
 * export in such a file becomes a callable server endpoint in the client
 * bundle's eyes, and the compiler is entitled to refuse anything that is not
 * a function. `AuthFormState` and `AuthField` were exported from it and
 * imported by six components, which is the exact shape BUILD_06 ledger 10.7
 * names. It had not broken a build yet; it was a violation waiting for a
 * compiler version that enforces it.
 *
 * A plain module costs nothing and ends it. `actions.ts` imports these types
 * and exports async functions only; the six forms import from here.

   *
   * The case that created this: signing in during the account-deletion grace

   * enforces "deactivated" rather than every screen remembering a flag, and
