 *
 * The two utility parameters use opposite set logic on purpose, and the URL
 * says so by naming one after a requirement and one after a source. Backup
 * power and a Band A feeder are independent facts a place can have both of, so
 * asking for both means both. Water comes from one place, so asking for a
 * borehole and treated mains means either would do; as an AND it would match
 * nothing, every time, which is not a filter but a trap.
 *
 * Money: the URL is the human boundary, so it carries naira, and this module is
 * the only place that multiplies. Everything downstream, including every field
 * of `ListingSearchFilter`, is integer kobo.
 *
 * Parsing is defensive by construction. Every reader below either returns a
 * clean value or `undefined`; nothing throws, nothing propagates NaN, and an
 * address full of rubbish renders the unfiltered page rather than an error.
