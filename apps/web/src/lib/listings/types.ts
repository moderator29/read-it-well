   *
   * What it obliges a surface to do:
   *
   *   1. **Say so, on the card and on the page.** Not in a tooltip, not in a

   *      property is available. Vallo has not verified anything on this page."

   *      copy and are enforced by `tests/agent-identity.spec.mjs`; "example"

   *   2. **Render no action that implies a transaction.** Book, reserve, pay
   *      and request an inspection must raise an explanation rather than a
   *      flow. The database refuses all four anyway, so a control that appears
   *      to work would produce an error the person cannot act on.
   *   3. **Render no trust mark.** `verified` is already false on every one of
   *      these (see below), so a component that reads `verified` is correct by

   * independent places so it cannot drift: a CHECK constraint refusing the
   * three stored trust columns, a trigger refusing a verified lister, and the
