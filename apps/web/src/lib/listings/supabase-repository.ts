 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Free text used to be matched only in memory, after the query

 * it is a wrong one: the term never reached SQL, so it could only ever find
 * something inside the 200 most recent listings, and the 201st was invisible to
 * it. These groups make the term narrow the rows, so the cap lands on MATCHING
 * listings instead of recent ones.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS OBEYS. `matchesFilter` stays the authority, exactly as it does
 * for budget and for everything else here, and it asks whether the term is a
 * substring of `title area city state kind`. So SQL may return rows the matcher
 * will drop, and may never drop a row the matcher would have kept. Every choice
 * below is made to keep that one-directional:
 *
 *   Words are ANDed, columns are ORed. If the whole term is a substring of that
 *   joined haystack, then each word of the term is a substring of it too, and a
 *   word has no space in it, so it must sit inside a single one of those fields
 *   rather than straddle two. Requiring every word somewhere is therefore a
 *   superset of requiring the phrase in one piece, and a far tighter one than
 *   asking for any word anywhere.
 *
 *   Punctuation becomes a wildcard rather than being deleted. `%` matches the
 *   character it replaced, so a pattern can only ever match more than the raw
 *   word did. Deleting instead would turn `a,b` into `ab`, which stops matching
 *   the row that says `a,b`, and that is the one direction not allowed here. It
 *   also means a user typing `%` gets a literal-ish wildcard of our choosing
 *   rather than a pattern of theirs that matches the entire catalogue.
 *
 *   State and kind are matched here in JavaScript, against the same reference
 *   map the rows are decorated from, because the haystack holds a state's NAME
 *   while the row holds its code. Somebody searching Ogun has to reach a
 *   listing in Abeokuta, and no `ilike` over the listings table can do that.
 *   When the reference map is empty the codes drop out of the predicate, and
 *   the matcher is reading a haystack built from that same empty map, so the
 *   two narrow together rather than disagreeing.

     * published listing is by definition a verified one; that is how this
     * repository once shipped twenty-three invented places with twenty-two of

     * example listings and left the real defect completely intact: EVERY
     * genuine listing still got the tick the moment it went live, whether or
     * not one person had ever looked at one document about the agent behind it.
     *
     * Meanwhile the whole apparatus for deciding this already existed and was
     * wired to nothing a stranger could see: four rungs in
     * `agent_verification_checks`, a tier computed by `private.agent_tier`, and
     * an admin queue that passes and fails each rung by hand.
     *
     * So the badge is now that decision, published through `agent_badges`:
     * a person here looked at a government document and said yes. Both
     * conditions have to hold. An example listing is never verified whatever
     * its lister's tier says, and a real listing from an agent nobody has
     * checked yet is not verified either - it is simply a listing, which is
     * what it is.
     *

     * immediately and sell nothing on our word until we have earned the right
