/**
 * When the example collection comes down.
 *
 * A dataset with no expiry becomes permanent by accident. Forty two example
 * properties were added because an empty catalogue looks broken, and "we will
 * take them out when real listings arrive" is not a plan, it is the sentence
 * that is still true in two years. So there is a date, it is written on every
 * row in `listings.demo_retire_after`, and it is mirrored here because the
 * thing that has to notice the date passing is the build, not a person.
 *
 * `retirement.test.ts` is the alarm. It fails once this date is behind us and
 * the tree still ships the example collection with nothing that removes it.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A SILENT SWITCH. Nothing in the reading path compares the
 * clock to this date and starts hiding rows. A catalogue that empties itself
 * overnight with no warning is a worse failure than a red build: discovery,
 * the map and every city page would go blank at once and the cause would be
 * invisible from any screen. The switch already exists and is deliberate:
 * `excludeDemo` on `ListingSearchFilter`, pushed down to SQL. This date is
 * what makes somebody reach for it.
 */

/**
 * The day the example collection is due out, as an ISO date in Africa/Lagos.
 *
 * Ninety days from the day the rows landed (2026-08-09). Ninety because
 * DEMO-1, recruiting real listers by hand, is a fortnight of phone calls
 * repeated a few times, and because a quarter is long enough that nobody can
 * claim they were not given a run at it.
 *
 * MOVING THIS DATE IS ALLOWED, ONCE THE REASON IS WRITTEN DOWN. Change it
 * here, change `listings.demo_retire_after` in a migration, and say in the
 * migration header what changed about the world. What is not allowed is
 * deleting the check because it went red.
