/**
 * THE ALARM ON THE EXAMPLE COLLECTION.
 *
 * Forty two properties that do not exist are in the catalogue because it was
 * otherwise empty. They are temporary. Everything about a temporary dataset
 * says it will still be here in two years unless something loud objects, so
 * this is the something.
 *
 * IF YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE THE BUILD WENT RED, here is what it means
 * and what to do.
 *
 *   The retirement date has passed and this tree still ships the example
 *   collection with nothing that removes it. That is not a broken test. It is
 *   the test doing the only job it has.
 *
 *   The fix is a migration that deletes the example rows, after which this
 *   spec finds it and goes quiet. `excludeDemo` on `ListingSearchFilter`
 *   hides them from every read in the meantime and is the right first move if
 *   the deletion needs a moment's thought.
 *
 *   Moving the date is allowed and deleting this spec is not. Change
 *   `EXAMPLE_COLLECTION_RETIREMENT`, change `listings.demo_retire_after` in a
 *   migration, and write in the migration header what changed about the world.
 *   A date that moves with a reason on record is a decision. A check deleted
 *   because it went red is how the collection becomes permanent.
