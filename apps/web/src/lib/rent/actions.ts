/**
 * The rent payment step: the one write that opens the charge.
 *
 * A1-001. Until this file existed a tenancy could be inspected and accepted
 * on the platform and then had to be paid for somewhere else. This action
 * opens the payable record for an accepted inspection; everything after it
 * rides the booking checkout exactly as a stay does. `payWithWallet`,
 * `payWithSavedCard` and `startCardCheckout` in `lib/bookings/checkout.ts`
 * take the booking this opens, under their own idempotency scopes, their own
 * `rm-book-` references, their own webhook settlement and the ledger row that
 * pays the agent. Nothing about money is re-implemented here, and there is
 * deliberately no second idempotency scope: opening the charge is idempotent
 * in the database (one charge per inspection), and paying it is guarded where
 * paying is guarded.
 *
 * The write is one call to `public.open_rent_charge`, the service-role door
 * to `private.open_rent_charge`, which checks that the inspection is the
 * caller's, that the lister accepted it, that the listing is a published
 * rental with a move-in figure, and inserts the booking and the tenancy
 * record in one transaction. The caller's id comes from the session, never
 * from the form. The figure is the listing's own move-in arithmetic, frozen
 * on the charge, and is never taken from the client.
