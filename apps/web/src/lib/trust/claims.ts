/**
 * THE CLAIMS RULE, EXECUTABLE (V-02).
 *
 * A word that promises something ("verified", "checked", "secure", "safe",
 * "guaranteed", "encrypted", "protected", "insured") may appear in copy a
 * person reads only when a mechanism in this codebase makes it true. Every
 * such use is either
 *
 *   - BACKED: it matches an entry below, and the entry names the mechanism
 *     (a column, a policy, a provider, a guard) that makes it true; or
 *   - NOT A CLAIM: a negation ("not protected by us", "we have not checked"),
 *     or the word in its everyday sense ("once you have checked out").
 *
 * Anything else fails `claims.test.ts`, which runs in `npm run lint` and before
 * `npm run build`. Adding a claim means adding its mechanism here, in the same
 * change, where a reviewer can read both.
 *
 * WHEN IT STOPS A BUILD. Because the check is in `prebuild`, a hotfix that
 * adds a sentence with one of these words will not build until the claim is
 * backed. The remedy is one line: add `{ phrase: /the exact words/i,
 * mechanism: "what makes it true" }` to BACKED_CLAIMS below (or reword the
 * sentence). The failure message prints the file, line and sentence. Do not
 * remove the check from `prebuild` to get a build out; a false claim shipped
 * is the thing it exists to stop.
 *
 * The check runs under vitest, so `prebuild` needs the web app's
 * devDependencies installed (a production-only install cannot build).
 *
 * Scope: the app's copy, the four locale catalogues and the English modules
 * they are assembled from (packages/i18n/src/locales/*.en.ts), the auth email templates
 * in supabase/templates, the native shell's offline page and the iOS and
 * Android native strings.
 *
 * Client-safe: plain data and pure functions.
