/**
 * THE BADGE, AS THIS CODEBASE IS ALLOWED TO KNOW IT.
 *
 * There is one derivation of the verified badge and it is in the database.
 * `public.person_badge` publishes it per person and `public.agent_badges.tier`
 * carries the same answer on the row a listing already joins. Both are computed
 * by `public.badge_tier(is_staff, is_checked)` off
 * `public.is_platform_staff` and `public.is_checked_person`, and each of those
 * three says its thing exactly once. Migration `20260923111950`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES, AND THE LIST IS SHORT ON PURPOSE. It names the tiers,
 * it READS the published value, and it carries the words a surface prints. It
 * does NOT decide anything. There is no rule in this file that says who gets a
 * badge, because the moment there is one, this codebase has a second derivation
 * and two screens can disagree about a stranger somebody is about to send a
 * deposit to. That has happened once already on this exact badge, and
 * `agent-badge-derivation.test.ts` exists to stop it happening again.
 *
 * SO, CONCRETELY, WHAT MAY NEVER APPEAR HERE OR ANYWHERE IN `src`:
 *   - `isAgent ? "gold" : "none"`, or any other reading off a role marker.
 *     `social_profiles.is_agent` says a person holds an APPROVED agents row.
 *     Approval is not a check of anybody. Its own column comment says so: "a
 *     role marker, not an earned badge".
 *   - `isAdmin ? "platinum" : ...` computed from a session or a claim.
 *   - `verificationTier >= 1 ? "gold" : "none"`. That rule is real and it lives
 *     in the database, where the constraint is.
 *   - any precedence between the two tiers. Platinum beats gold, and that
 *     decision is `public.badge_tier` and nothing else, so that no component
 *     can quietly answer it differently.
 *
 * THE FAILURE DIRECTION IS DECIDED AND IT IS "NO MARK". An unknown value, a
 * missing row, a failed read and a null all come back `none`. A tick that fails
 * to appear costs somebody a second look. A tick that appears with no check
 * behind it is the product lying about a stranger's trustworthiness on the
 * screen where money moves.
