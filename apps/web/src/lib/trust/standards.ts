/**
 * The response times RentMe publishes, as data.
 *
 * A stated response time is only worth anything if the console that has to
 * keep it reads the same number the public page prints. So the commitments
 * live here, client-safe, and both sides import them: the standards page
 * prints them, and the admin queues compute a due time from them and say when
 * a row is overdue.
 *
 * The numbers are deliberately conservative. A promise of one hour that is
 * kept two thirds of the time is worse than a promise of four hours that is
 * always kept, because the first one teaches people that our promises are
 * decoration.
