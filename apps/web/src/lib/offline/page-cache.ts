/**
 * THE PAGE'S SIDE OF THE KEPT PAGES (8 October 2026). `public/sw.js` keeps
 * every page a member opens so it opens again with no signal; this module is
 * the three things a page says to it, and the one thing it asks.
 *
 *   - `announceVisit`  a tap inside the app is a data fetch, not a page load,
 *                      so the worker never sees the page. The page tells it
 *                      the address, and the worker keeps a copy in the
 *                      background (never under Save-Data or on 2g; the worker
 *                      decides, and the server says whose page it is).
 *   - `forgetKeptPages` sign-out. Every kept page is deleted from here AND
 *                      the worker is told, so a shared phone never opens the
 *                      previous account's screens. Either hand alone is
 *                      enough; both run because a sign-out is the one moment
 *                      that must not depend on a worker being awake.
 *   - `keptCopyKind`   whether this document came from the phone rather than
 *                      the network, and which way: at once ("instant", the
 *                      network refreshing it behind) or because the network
 *                      failed or dawdled ("kept"). The worker marks it with a
 *                      Server-Timing entry and a `data-vallo-kept` attribute.
 *   - `onFreshCopy`    the worker found the network after all and kept a
 *                      fresh copy: the page refreshes itself in place.
 *
 * Every function is a no-op where there is no worker (a browser without one,
 * a private window, the development server), and none of them throws.
