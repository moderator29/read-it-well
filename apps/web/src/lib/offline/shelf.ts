/**
 * THE SHORTLIST, KEPT ON THE PHONE. V-77.
 *
 * People shortlist on the move and compare on a danfo, and a shortlist that
 * vanishes in a dead zone is not a shortlist. So every time `/saved` is read
 * with signal, a light copy of each saved listing is written to the phone
 * (`shelf-store.ts`, IndexedDB `vallo-shelf`), and with no signal the offline
 * page draws the list and a side-by-side compare from it.
 *
 * WHAT A COPY HOLDS. The card's own figures, computed by the same functions
 * the card uses (`cardPrice`, `cardUtility`), so the offline row cannot
 * disagree with the online one: the move-in total or the headline price, the
 * rent beneath it, bedrooms, bathrooms, the power line, the area and state,
 * and whether it is an example listing (drawn with the same Example mark the
 * card carries). NOT the title: the lister's own words are shown only on
 * the listing's page, so a copy is named by its rooms and area instead.
 * No address, no lister contact, no photograph (photographs are the heavy
 * part and the service worker does not cache images; the row says what it
 * has rather than drawing an empty frame).
 *
 * WAS AND IS NOW. The first figure the phone ever stored for a listing is
 * kept beside the current one, with the date it stored it. When a refresh
 * finds the figure moved, the change says exactly that: "the rent was
 * ₦2,400,000 when this phone first kept it on 3 Oct; it is ₦2,600,000 now."
 * It does NOT say "when you saved it": the phone's first copy may be long
 * after the save, and the save's own figure was never recorded.
 *
 * ONE OWNER. The shelf records the account it was synced for
 * (`shelf-store.ts`); a sync for a different account starts from nothing, so
 * one person's first figures never become another's "was".
 *
 * THE LIST IS THE ACCOUNT'S, NOT THE PHONE'S. A refresh replaces the shelf
 * with exactly what `/saved` returned, so an unsaved listing leaves the phone
 * the next time there is signal. Fifty at most, most recently saved first.
