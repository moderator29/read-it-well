/**
 * PERF-SWEEP 6: a deadline on the server client's database and auth calls.
 *
 * The request-scoped server client had no timeout of its own. A PostgREST or
 * GoTrue call that stalled with its socket open held the page's render until
 * the platform stopped the function, and for all of that time the person
 * looked at the route's skeleton, which is the "loading stuck" the founder
 * reported. With a deadline the stalled call fails like any other failed
 * read: supabase-js hands the caller an `{ error }` (or an auth outage), the
 * page draws its own honest failure state or the route's error boundary, and
 * a retry is one tap away.
 *
 * WHAT IS CUT, AND WHAT IS NOT. Only the short request and response calls
 * are cut: `/rest/v1` (tables and RPCs), `/auth/v1` and `/graphql/v1`.
 * Storage uploads and Edge Functions are left alone, because a large photo
 * on a slow line can honestly take longer than any read should.
 *
 * The budget is generous on purpose. In the database's own statistics
 * (pg_stat_statements, 29 September 2026) the slowest app call peaked near
 * two seconds; nothing healthy comes near fifteen, so
 * the deadline only ever fires on a call that was not going to come back.
 * A signal the caller already passed (supabase-js `abortSignal`) is kept:
 * whichever fires first ends the call.

 * its own answer deadline (OPS-05), and aborting a refresh halfway could
