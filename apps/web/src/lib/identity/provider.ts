/**
 * THE IDENTITY AGGREGATOR (V-49), AS AN INTERFACE.
 *
 * NIMC's virtual NIN is exposed by several licensed aggregators (Dojah,
 * Youverify, Prembly, QoreID, VerifyMe, Smile ID). Which one holds Vallo's
 * users' identity checks is founder question 4, so the product is built
 * against this interface and ships with:
 *
 *   unconfigured  the production default until a contract is signed: it
 *                 verifies nothing and says so, and `vnin_identity` stays off.
 *   stub          for tests: answers from a fixture table keyed by token.
 *
 * THE ONE SWAP. Implement `IdentityProvider` for the chosen aggregator (the
 * vNIN lookup), return it from
 * `identityProvider()` when its key is present, set VALLO_NIN_HMAC_KEY, and
 * turn the flag on.
 *
 * NO SELFIE, SO NO LIVENESS. No screen captures one, so the interface does
 * not pretend to carry a score; a face match is a later addition with its own
 * capture step.
 *
 * WHAT A PROVIDER RETURNS AND WHAT HAPPENS TO IT. The NIN comes back so it can
 * be HMACed at once (`nin.ts`) and then dropped: it is never stored, logged or
 * returned to a screen. The legal name is kept, because the name is what the
 * rung, the payout match and the account check compare with.
