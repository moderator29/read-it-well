/**
 * "WHERE DO I FIND..." FROM THE APP'S OWN LIST OF SCREENS (AI-05).
 *
 * The model used to answer navigation questions from paths typed into its
 * prompt, which is how an assistant names a screen that does not exist. This
 * tool answers from the route registry instead: every screen declared in
 * `lib/nav/route-parents.ts` that `lib/nav/route-labels.ts` gives a name, kept
 * only when
 *
 *   - `isKnownRoute` answers true for it;
 *   - it has no dynamic segment (`[id]`), since a path with a hole in it is
 *     not somewhere a person can be sent;
 *   - it is not under `/admin` (or the dev-only previews, or an alias that
 *     only redirects); and
 *   - it belongs to the frame the assistant was opened in: the agent
 *     workspace sees `/agent` screens, the host workspace `/host` screens,
 *     and the plain concierge every member screen outside the workspaces.
 *
 * The words that help a need find a screen ("viewing times" finding
 * Inspections) are model-facing hints kept here, not interface copy.
