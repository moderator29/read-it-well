 * The concierge could search and it could read an area, and between those two
 * it could not do the thing people spend most of their time doing on a
 * property site: holding two places against each other. Asked to compare, a
 * model with only a search tool re-runs the search, gets a differently ordered
 * five, and answers from whichever rows came back, which is how a listing that
 * was never mentioned ends up in a comparison.
 *
 * This resolves the exact ids it is given, one row each, and returns them in
 * the order asked for. A row that cannot be found comes back as an explicit
 * not-found entry rather than being dropped, so the model cannot quietly
 * compare two things when it was asked about three.

/**
 * The same row, described for a comparison rather than for a shelf.
 *
 * Deliberately a different shape from the search result. A search answer is
 * "here are five places"; a comparison answer is "these are the four numbers
 * that differ". So this carries the light and water answers, which search
 * summarises into an amenity list, and it carries them as `unanswered` where
 * the host skipped the question rather than omitting the key. That is the one
 * place omission would be wrong: in a side by side, a missing row reads as a
 * no, and "the host did not say" is not a no.
