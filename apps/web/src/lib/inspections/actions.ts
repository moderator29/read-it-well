/**
 * MOVING AN INSPECTION.
 *
 * Four actions and no more: ask, answer, take the time you were offered, pull
 * out. Everything about WHO may do WHICH is decided in the database by
 * `private.guard_inspection_transition`, and nothing here re-implements it.
 *
 * That split is deliberate and it is the same one the money layer uses. A
 * state machine written twice is a state machine that will disagree with
 * itself, and the copy that matters is the one an attacker cannot skip. These
 * functions validate shapes, name the row, and translate a refusal into a
 * sentence somebody can act on.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE: a confirm action for the requester on their own request.
 * The database refuses that transition; there is no reason for a door in front
 * of a wall.
 *
 * WHAT IS HERE, ON TOP OF THE GUARD. Each move reads the row first and writes
 * only from the state it read (`.eq("state", read)`), and asks for the row
 * back. Row-level security answers an update it does not allow with zero rows
 * and no error, and the guard returns early when the state does not change,
 * so without this a stranger's tap, a second tab or a stale screen came back
 * "ok" while nothing moved, or quietly rewrote the agreed time. A write that
 * returns no row is now said as what it is: the request moved on.

/**
 * I1b. THE ROW THAT MAKES AN UPLOADED OBJECT PART OF THE REPORT.
 *
 * `createInspectionPhotoUpload` hands the browser a signed URL and the browser
 * PUTs the bytes straight at storage. Nothing reaches this server in between,
 * which is the point: a photo of a damp wall does not need to travel through a
 * server action to get into a bucket. But an object sitting in a bucket that no
 * row points at is invisible to every screen, so this is the second half, and
 * the screen calls it once the upload resolves.
 *
 * WHY THE PATH IS CHECKED HERE AS WELL AS IN STORAGE. The bucket's own policies
 * read the first path segment (`private.inspection_photo_path_access`), so a
 * person genuinely cannot write bytes into somebody else's folder. This row is a
 * different object in a different schema, and nothing about the storage policy
 * stops a caller posting `{ inspectionId: mine, storagePath: "<someone else>/x.jpg" }`
 * and hanging their photo off my report. So the path's first segment must equal
 * the inspection it is being attached to, and the extension must be one we
 * issued. **A signed upload proves where the bytes went. It does not prove what
 * the caller then says about them.**
 *
 * The insert itself goes through the caller's own RLS-bound client, so being a
 * party to the inspection, and the report still being open, are both decided by
 * Postgres rather than restated here.
