/**
 * THE INSPECTION REPORT, AS THE SCREEN HOLDS IT.
 *
 * F6A8A482 (and founder/inspection-target.jpg) draws eight rooms to tick, a
 * notes field and Add Photos, and a Submit that stays disabled until all
 * eight are ticked. Migration 20260923135847
 * (applied 23 September) is the storage: `inspection_reports`,
 * `inspection_report_items`, `inspection_report_photos`, the private
 * `inspection-photos` bucket, and a trigger that refuses a submission with
 * fewer than eight ticks and moves the parent to COMPLETED in the same
 * transaction. The writes are `saveInspectionReport`,
 * `createInspectionPhotoUpload` and `addReportPhoto` (lib/inspections/actions.ts).
 *
 * This module is the screen's own view of a report and the rules for what
 * may be pressed. Pure, so it is tested rather than trusted.
