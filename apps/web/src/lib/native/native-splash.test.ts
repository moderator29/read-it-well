/**
 * THE NATIVE LAUNCH IMAGE CARRIES NO MARK (D68c, 7 October 2026).
 *
 * The founder's rule is absolute: the logo never appears by itself on app
 * open. The launch image is the one frame whose duration the web layer cannot
 * bound, so it is a flat `#010118` field, identical to the app's background.
 * `scripts/build-native-icons.mjs` writes every one of these files; this test
 * fails if any of them carries a single pixel that is not that navy, which is
 * what a regeneration with the old tile composition would do.
