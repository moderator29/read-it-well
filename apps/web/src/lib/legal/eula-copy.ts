 * The operative clause, and the one App Review's rejection message asks for.
 *
 * NOT QUOTABLE FROM THE GUIDELINES PAGE, and that is recorded here rather than
 * implied. The published text of guideline 1.2 contains no twenty four hour
 * figure and asks for no agreement of this kind; it asks for a filter, a
 * report mechanism with "timely responses to concerns", a block, and published
 * contact information. The twenty four hours and the zero tolerance wording
 * come from the rejection message, as reported consistently by developers who
 * have received it. We write to the rejection message because that is what a
 * refusal would carry, which makes this sentence a promise this company is
 * making rather than a quotation. Do not soften it without also changing what
 * the moderation queue does.
