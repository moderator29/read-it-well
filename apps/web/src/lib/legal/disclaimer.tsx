/**
 * THE DISCLAIMER (Track B, 25 September 2026).
 *
 * Founder directive: anything that happens off the platform is not Vallo's
 * responsibility, and that has to be said in a document of its own rather than
 * only inside the Terms, where nobody deciding whether to send a transfer will
 * find it. It forms part of the Terms (section 15 points here), and it is
 * rendered by `(site)/disclaimer` and `(app)/legal/disclaimer` from this one
 * array, so the two copies cannot differ.
 *
 * Every money sentence is read from `lib/money/copy.ts`.

          by mobile money, in crypto sent to anybody&rsquo;s address, or by any route other
          than the checkout on {COMPANY_TRADING_NAME}; conversations moved to WhatsApp, a
          phone call, email or any other app; agreements signed or varied outside the
          platform; and keys, documents or property handed over without a record on the
          platform.

          What a listing says, including its photographs, its price and any title it
          states, is what the person who listed it says. A verified badge tells you who
          somebody is, not how they will behave. Have a lawyer verify title at the land
          registry before money moves on any purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Price Check reports what places on the platform are asking. Price Check
          figures, area notes and anything written by the assistant are guidance, not
          legal advice or a survey, and they can be wrong.
