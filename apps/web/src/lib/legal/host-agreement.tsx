 * THE HOST AGREEMENT: what a host of a stay or a restaurant agrees to, beside
 * the Terms of service and the Privacy policy.
 *
 * A host agrees to all three before their business is created (the wizard's
 * business step), and the agreement is recorded on the business with the
 * moment and the version of each (`consents.agreements`). A business whose
 * host has not agreed to the current version is not sent for review and not
 * published. Plain words on purpose: a host should be able to read it in two
 * minutes and know exactly what they may and may not charge.
 *
 * Changing these words means a new HOST_AGREEMENT_VERSION, and every host is
 * then asked again before their next application is sent.

          nightly price, each rate, and every charge at the door (a caution deposit, power,
          cleaning, an extra guest, a visitor) are listed on your page before anybody books.

          A caution deposit is returned to the guest under the rules you listed with it. It is never

          Listing is free. Vallo charges a restaurant only for completed visits: a fee for each
          guest seated from a Vallo reservation, at the amount shown in your host settings before
          it applies. You mark each table seated or a no-show after its time, honestly.
