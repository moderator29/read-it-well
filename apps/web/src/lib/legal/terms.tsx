/**
 * Terms of service, as content rather than as a page.
 *
 * These sections are rendered in two places and must never differ between
 * them: `(site)/terms` for the public web, and `(app)/legal/terms` for
 * somebody already inside the product. The in-product copy exists because the
 * marketing page is a different application shell: tapping Terms of service in the
 * side navigation used to throw a signed-in person out of the product
 * entirely, and their back button then returned them to the marketing site
 * rather than to the screen they were reading a moment earlier.
 *
 * Two routes, one document. A legal text that says different things in two
 * places is not a legal text.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT CHANGED ON 15 SEPTEMBER 2026, AND WHY IT WAS URGENT
 *
 * Section 4 used to read: "Your payment is held securely by RentMe and
 * released to the agent only after check-in, or after you confirm that an
 * inspection matched the listing", and section 4 also said "the payment stays
 * held while we investigate". Section 9 then limited our liability "beyond the
 * protections described in sections 4 and 5", which leaned the whole liability
 * clause on that promise.
 *
 * **That was a binding contractual promise of escrow, and no guest's money has
 * ever moved that way.** It was checked rather than assumed before it was
 * removed:
 *
 *   - `public.escrows` DOES exist and is well built. There is a state machine
 *     enforced by a database trigger rather than only in TypeScript, four
 *     escrow purposes, an audit trigger, a timeout sweep, a locking
 *     SECURITY DEFINER settle function, and an admin resolution RPC behind
 *     `/admin/escrow`. The claim in some older notes that escrow is "zero
 *     percent built" is out of date and this file does not repeat it.
 *   - **Nothing routes a guest's payment into it.**
 *     `private.pay_booking_from_wallet` debits the payer and credits the payee
 *     in one transaction with no hold anywhere in it, no screen in the product
 *     can open a hold, and `public.booking_status` is still
 *     `PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED` with no COMPLETED, so there is no event
 *     that a release after check-in could fire on even if there were a flow.
 *
 * So the mechanism is real and unreachable, and the terms described the
 * mechanism as though a user could reach it. A person deciding whether to send
 * money to a stranger read that clause and relied on it.
 *
 * There is a second reason it could not simply be softened. **Holding client
 * funds between two parties is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria**, and
 * whether this company may operate such a service at all is an open question
 * the owner has not had answered. The corporate objects clause filed at the
 * Commission deliberately omits every payment and escrow word, because the
 * portal's classifier read those words as a regulated payments business and
 * demanded share capital of 500,000,000 naira. Promising in a contract a
 * service the memorandum does not permit is worse than promising one the code
 * does not implement.
 *
 * The clause now says what actually happens, and section 4 says plainly that
 * money is not held. **Restore a holding promise when there is a flow AND a
 * legal answer, not when either one arrives alone.**
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT CHANGED ON 25 SEPTEMBER 2026 (TRACK A AND TRACK B)
 *
 * The founder retired custody. Vallo holds no customer money at any point:
 * there is no wallet, no balance, no escrow and no held payment. Every charge
 * is split by the processor in the same transaction: the owner's or agent's
 * share to their own bank account through a Paystack subaccount, the Vallo
 * Guarantee contribution to a separate reserve, and Vallo's commission (zero
 * today) to Vallo. The old section 15 ("The wallet") is gone, section 4 now
 * describes the split, section 5 routes refunds to the card or account that
 * paid, and new sections describe the agreement and approval gate and the
 * Vallo Guarantee. Every money sentence is read from `lib/money/copy.ts`, the
 * module the screens and emails read, so the contract and the product say the
 * same thing. The Disclaimer (`lib/legal/disclaimer.tsx`) forms part of these
 * terms.
 *
 * The CBN point above now cuts the other way: the platform is designed so
 * that it never holds client funds, which is the position the objects clause
 * already takes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FOR THE SOLICITOR
 *
 * Provisions are not invented here: anything carrying real legal consequence goes to the Company Solicitor.
 * The clauses below are DESCRIPTIVE: each one says what the platform actually
 * does, which can be established from the code and the schema. None of them creates a new right or a new liability.
 *
 * These seven need a solicitor's eye before Launch and are marked here rather
 * than in a separate document that would drift away from the text. (The
 * numbers below were re-pointed on 25 September 2026, and before that on 16 September 2026 to the current section
 * numbering; three of them still named an older draft's numbers. The flags
 * themselves are unchanged.)
 *
 *   2   What Vallo is, which gained a paragraph on 22 September naming the
 *       position: Vallo does not remove the agent, it removes the runaround,
 *       and a fee an agent charges is the agent's and not ours. It is
 *       descriptive and nothing turns on it, but it is the first thing a
 *       reader meets and it is the one place these terms now say anything
 *       about somebody else's fee, so he should read it.
 *   4   Payments, now that it describes a direct payment rather than a hold.
 *       The consumer protection position changes when the platform is not
 *       holding the money, and that should be said correctly rather than
 *       merely accurately.
 *   5   Cancellations and refunds. The schedule is real and lives in
 *       `lib/trust/cancellation.ts`, but a refund promise is a financial
 *       commitment.
 *   6   The commission paragraph, which describes a fee that is set to zero
 *       today. It must not read as introducing one.
 *   13  Agreements and approval: what an approval means and does not.
 *   15  Limitation of liability, which no longer rests on a holding promise.
 *   16  Suspension, closure and the appeal route.
 *   19  Governing law, which must stay consistent with the Co-Founder and
 *       Investment Agreement: Nigerian law, and arbitration in Abuja under the
 *       Arbitration and Mediation Act 2023.
 *   14  The Vallo Guarantee: a discretionary, capped, reviewed protection
 *       funded from a reserve. It must not read as insurance or as an
 *       unconditional promise to pay.
 *
 * AND ONE CORRECTION OF FACT MADE ON 22 SEPTEMBER, recorded here because a
 * legal document should carry its own history. Section 7 described the
 * verification ladder as "phone, then identity document, then address, then a
 * physical inspection". There is no phone rung and there never was, and the
 * payout rung, the only automated check this platform has, was missing. So
 * the contract described a check we do not perform and omitted one we do. It
 * is no longer typed out here at all: it is read from
 * `lib/trust/verification.ts`, which is the array `private.agent_tier`
 * counts, so it cannot drift again. That is a correction of a false
 * statement, not a change of obligation, which is why it lands rather than
 * waiting.

          Before a rental or a stay is paid for on the platform, an agreement is drawn
          up from the listing&rsquo;s own figures and, for a rental, the inspection
          report. Both of you confirm the same version. Changing anything creates a new
          version and both of you confirm again.
        </p>
        <p>
          A person at {COMPANY_TRADING_NAME} then reviews the agreement and approves it,
          or sends it back with a reason. Both of you are told by email and in the app.
          Payment opens only after approval. Approval means the agreement is complete and
          consistent with the listing and the report; it is not a guarantee of the
          property, the owner or the agent, and every decision is logged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where an agent confirms for an owner, the agent confirms that they hold the
          owner&rsquo;s mandate to do so.
