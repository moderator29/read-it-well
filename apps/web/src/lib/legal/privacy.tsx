    title: "2. The data we collect",
    body: (
      <>
        <p>We collect only what the platform needs to work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account data.</strong> Your name, email address, phone number if you
            give one, password (stored only in hashed form), language, the state and
            local government you choose, your occupation if you give it, and the
            interests you pick.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your public profile and what you post.</strong> Your display name,
            handle, photo, cover picture and bio, and the posts, comments, stories,
            reactions and follows you make in the social part of Vallo. These are
            visible to other members, as the profile screen shows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What you list.</strong> If you list a property or a stay: its
            description, photographs, videos, price, address and, if you drop a pin or
            tap &quot;use my location&quot;, its map position. The street address can be
            read by members who are signed in; it is not shown to anybody who is not.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bookings, messages and reviews.</strong> The listings you save, the
            bookings, reservations and inspections you make, the messages you exchange
            with the people who list, and the reviews you write.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment data.</strong> Payment references, amounts, how each payment
            was split (the lister&rsquo;s share, the Vallo Guarantee contribution and
            our commission), refunds, and, if you save them, a card token and the bank
            account you nominate for payouts. We do not keep a wallet or a balance for
            you, because we never hold your money. Card numbers are handled by Paystack;
            we never see or store your full card number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Agreements and Guarantee claims.</strong> The agreements you draw
            up and confirm, their versions, Vallo&rsquo;s decision and its reason, and,
            if you make a claim on the Vallo Guarantee, what you claimed, the photographs
            and evidence you upload, and the decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification data.</strong> If you apply to list as an agent or a
            host: your government ID or NIN, business registration documents where
            they apply, and the bank account you nominate for payouts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Location.</strong> Your device location is read only when you ask
            for it: to place a listing&rsquo;s pin, to centre the map on where you are,
            or to save a spot for a price check (stored to about 100 metres). We do not
            track your location in the background.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What you type to the AI assistant or the support chat.</strong>{" "}
            Assistant conversations are kept on your account so you can come back to
            them; the support chat is kept on your device, and a ticket you open with a
            person is kept on your account. What you type is processed by Anthropic to
            write the answers, only if you agree to it. See section 12.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Devices and notifications.</strong> If you turn notifications on, the
            notification address your phone or browser gives us and a short device name
            (&quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;Android phone&quot;). To warn you when your account
            is used on a new device, we keep a code derived from the device and browser
            you sign in with, and the browser and platform of each signed-in session.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical data.</strong> IP address, browser and device type in our
            hosting and database logs, used to keep the service working and secure. If
            something crashes, a crash report with the error, the page and the device
            type, with personal details removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Price checks.</strong> When you use the price check, we record the
            area, the kind of property and how far you got, against your account, so we
            can see whether it gives useful answers. That and the sign-up step counts
            below are the only records we keep of how the product is used. There is no
            other analytics and no advertising tracking in Vallo.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sign-up step counts.</strong> We count, ourselves, how many visits
            reach each step of joining Vallo: opening the home page, starting to sign up,
            and, once you have an account, your first search and your first save. Each
            count carries the language, whether it was the website or the app, the part
            of the page you came from, and a random visit number kept in a cookie that is
            deleted when you close your browser. Before you have an account nothing ties a
            count to you; after, the first search and the first save are linked to your
            account only so that each is counted once. Nothing is shared with anyone, and
            the counts are deleted after 90 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emails we send you.</strong> A record of each one is kept for 90
            days after it is delivered, so we can answer whether it arrived. A record of
            an email that could not be delivered is kept until a person at Vallo has
            dealt with it.

        <p>
          We keep personal data only as long as we need it. While your account is open we
          keep your profile, your content and your records. When you delete your account,
          two different things happen to two different kinds of data, and this section
          says plainly which is which.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You can delete your account yourself,</strong> in Settings then Account,
          in the app or on this website. You do not need to write to us and we do not do
          it by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nothing is destroyed for {GRACE_WINDOW_DAYS} days.</strong> The moment
          you confirm, your account is signed out everywhere and deactivated: you cannot
          sign in and nobody can reach your profile. We email you the date the deletion
          runs and a code that stops it. If you use that code inside the window,
          everything is put back and nothing has been lost. At the end of the{" "}
          {GRACE_WINDOW_DAYS} days a scheduled job runs the deletion, and we email you
          again when it has finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Destroyed outright.</strong> Your profile and the details in it, your
          photograph and cover picture, your posts, comments, stories and unpublished
          drafts, your saved properties, stays, tables, searches and interests, your
          search history, the devices you are signed in on and the device records we keep
          to warn you about new sign-ins, your notification addresses, your
          notifications, the emails we had queued or sent you, your price checks and saved
          price-check spots, your assistant conversations, your saved cards and bank
          accounts, and every file you have uploaded, including host documents and the
          identity and agency documents of anybody who applied to be an agent and was not
          approved. The files are removed from storage, not merely the records that
          point at them. The one exception is an approved agent&rsquo;s identification,
          described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your email address is not kept.</strong> We keep only a one-way keyed
          code made from it, which cannot be turned back into the address. Our staff can
          use it only to see that a new account uses the same mailbox as a deleted one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Money is never deleted with an account.</strong> On the day the deletion
          runs we check again. If a payment or a refund is still in progress, a Guarantee
          claim is open, or money is owed to you or by you, the deletion
          waits: nothing is destroyed, a person at Vallo is told, and we contact you to
          settle it first. Your code to stop the deletion keeps working while it waits.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kept, with you removed from it.</strong> Vallo is registered with the
          Special Control Unit against Money Laundering and is subject to Nigeria&rsquo;s
          Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, which requires a business
          that moves money to retain its transaction records for at least five years after
          the transaction. So your bookings, reservations, agreements, payments, Guarantee claims,
          platform revenue lines, payout records, inspection requests and reviews are kept
          for that period. Your name, email address and telephone number are removed from
          every one of them, and what remains is an amount, a date and a reference that no
          longer identifies you. Messages you have sent stay in the other person&rsquo;s
          conversation so their side of the thread is still readable, with the sender
          shown as a deleted account.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This is the retention exception to your right to erasure,</strong> and
          section 8 sets out how to exercise that right. The NDPA permits us to keep
          personal data where another law requires us to, and this is that case. It is
          limited to the records named above, for the period named above, and to nothing
          else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verification documents are the clearest example of the line. If you were
          approved as an agent, you were a customer under the same anti money laundering
          law, which requires us to keep your identification. So when you delete your
          account we keep, for five years after it closes, your identity and agency
          documents, your name, residential address, ID type and number, business
          registration and payout account details. Only our staff can read them, and at
          the end of the five years they are destroyed. If you applied and were not
          approved, none of this is kept: the documents and the numbers are destroyed with
          the rest of your account.
        </p>
