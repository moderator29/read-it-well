/**
 * Nigerian mobile numbers: one canonical form, one set of ranges, one place.
 *
 * Client-safe on purpose. This module is imported by a form component AND by
 * server-side validation, and a second copy of any of it would drift: the
 * booking schema and the agent application already disagreed, one accepting
 * `0` followed by ten digits regardless of what those digits were, the other
 * insisting the national number begin 7, 8 or 9. The same number was valid on
 * one screen and refused on the other.
 *
 * SHAPE. Every Nigerian mobile is ten digits after the country code and begins
 * 7, 8 or 9. That is the structural rule and it is the only thing that ever
 * REFUSES a number here.
 *
 * CARRIER. The three digits after that identify the network, from the NCC's
 * allocations. Knowing it is worth real money to a guest: a host reading
 * "MTN" beside a number can tell at a glance that the digits are plausible,
 * and somebody who typed 0813 when they meant 0803 sees the network change
 * under their thumb.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN PREFIX IS NOT AN INVALID NUMBER, and this is the important
 * decision in this file. The NCC issues new ranges, and a shipped allow-list
 * is a dated document: hard-refusing anything outside it would reject the very
 * first customer on a range issued next year, on a booking form, with no way
 * for them to argue. So an unrecognised prefix is reported as unrecognised,
 * the number is still accepted, and the person is told plainly which of the
 * two situations they are in. Refusing a real number is a much more expensive
 * mistake than accepting a wrong one, because the wrong one is caught the
 * first time somebody rings it and the real one is a lost booking.
