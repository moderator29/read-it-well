/**
 * The one way to reach a person, and the one place that decides what it is.
 *
 * This module used to hand out `support@rentme.ng`. **That mailbox does not
 * exist.** Six surfaces printed it as a live link, and two of them were
 * Privacy and Terms, which is where somebody goes to exercise a data right
 * under the NDPA. A wrong domain sends mail to the wrong place; an address
 * with no mailbox behind it sends it nowhere, silently, and the person who
 * wrote it believes they have asked. That is worse than the naijafinds.com
 * split this file was originally written to fix.
 *
 * So the module hands out a **channel** rather than an address.
 *
 * With no mailbox configured, every one of those surfaces points at
 * `/contact`, which is not a placeholder: the form there writes a real
 * `support_tickets` row under RLS, an admin reads it in the console at
 * `/admin/support`, and a reply notifies the person who sent it. It is a
 * working channel today, which a mailto is not.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS NOW INVERTED, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS EDIT. Setting
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` used to flip all six surfaces to `mailto:` in
 * one environment change, which meant the day a mailbox appeared, every
 * "contact support" control on the platform started throwing people into
 * their mail application whether they wanted that or not.
 *
 * A mail client is THE ONE PERMITTED EXIT from Vallo, and it is permitted
 * because somebody CHOSE to be emailed. A default is not a choice. So
 * `SUPPORT_HREF` is `/contact` in both worlds now, and the mailbox, when it
 * exists, is offered BESIDE the form as a second control the person can take
 * or ignore. `/contact` already renders exactly that, as copyable text with
 * its own mailto beside it.
 *
 * Nothing else about the module changes: `SUPPORT_MAILBOX` is still the one
 * place that knows whether an address exists, and the surfaces that
 * deliberately offer the mail application read `SUPPORT_MAILTO_HREF`.
