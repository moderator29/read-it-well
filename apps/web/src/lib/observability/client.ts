/**
 * The browser's half of crash reporting: a POST to our own origin.
 *
 * ## Why the browser does not talk to the vendor directly
 *
 * Three reasons, and the first is the one that decided it:
 *
 * 1. **The DSN stays server side.** A browser transport needs a public DSN
 *    in the bundle, which means a second environment variable, a second
 *    thing to rotate and a public ingest endpoint anybody can post junk to
 *    under our project's name. Posting to our own route means `SENTRY_DSN`
 *    is read in exactly one place, on the server, and the browser never
 *    holds it.
 * 2. **One scrubber, not two.** Everything that leaves for the vendor goes
 *    through `lib/observability/scrub.ts` on the server. A direct browser
 *    transport would need the same allowlist shipped to the client, where it
 *    would drift, and where a bundle could be read to learn exactly what we
 *    filter.
 * 3. **The Content Security Policy stays shut.** A same-origin POST needs
 *    nothing added to `connect-src`, so crash reporting does not widen the
 *    policy that `lib/security/csp.ts` spent its length tightening.
 *
 * ## It is best effort and it says so
 *
 * `keepalive` lets the report survive the page being navigated away from or
 * closed, which is the common shape of a fatal client error. Every failure
 * is swallowed: this function is called from inside error boundaries, and a
 * reporter that throws inside an error boundary is an infinite loop.
 *
 * Nothing is printed here. The boundaries already `console.error` the real
 * error, and a second line about telemetry is noise on top of a crash.
