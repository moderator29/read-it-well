/**
 * Crash and error reporting: the one door, and the only thing that reads
 * `SENTRY_DSN`.
 *
 * Until this file existed the product was about to enter two app stores with
 * no crash reporting at all. Neither store gives you the crash data back, so
 * the first real user's crash would have been invisible for ever: the only
 * signal would have been a one-star review describing a screen we cannot
 * reproduce.
 *
 * ## Why a direct transport and NOT `@sentry/nextjs`
 *
 * This was decided rather than defaulted, and the reasons are in the order
 * they weighed:
 *
 * 1. **Rule 16 is absolute and the SDK's defaults are the opposite of it.**
 *    `@sentry/nextjs` auto-instruments fetch, the router and the request
 *    pipeline, and attaches request data, headers, cookies and breadcrumbs
 *    of every network call by default. `sendDefaultPii` is off by default,
 *    but that switch does not cover breadcrumb bodies, and the surface that
 *    would have to be audited is the whole SDK rather than one function. A
 *    transport that can only ever send an explicitly built object cannot
 *    leak a field nobody thought about.
 * 2. **The dependency is not free in the sense that matters.** It pulls
 *    roughly forty packages and a webpack plugin, it rewrites `next.config`,
 *    and its source-map upload step wants an auth token and an org, which is
 *    account setup and CI credentials this build has not got.
 * 3. **The envelope endpoint is a documented, stable HTTP API.** What we
 *    need from it is one POST. The SDK's value is the parts we are
 *    deliberately not using: automatic instrumentation and breadcrumbs.
 * 4. **No lockfile entry, so nothing to install.** `@sentry/nextjs` is not
 *    in `package-lock.json` and is not vendored in this sandbox, so adding
 *    it would have been an install this environment cannot prove.
 *
 * The cost is stated honestly: no breadcrumbs, no automatic performance
 * tracing, no release health, and stack traces arrive minified because
 * nothing uploads source maps. The digest and the route pattern are what tie
 * a report back to a deployment. If the founder later wants symbolication,
 * that is a source-map upload step, not a reason to adopt the SDK's default
 * data collection.
 *
 * ## Absent means absent
 *
 * With no `SENTRY_DSN` every call returns `{ sent: false }` and prints
 * nothing. Not a warning, not a hint, not once per boot. A development
 * console that cries about unconfigured telemetry on every error is a
 * console people stop reading, and this module's whole job is to not be the
 * reason a real line is missed.
 *
 * There is no fallback service, no second vendor and no hardcoded DSN. The
 * DSN itself is never printed: a parse failure reports the token
 * `sentry_dsn_unparseable` and not the value that failed.
 *
 * ## It cannot fail the thing it is reporting on
 *
 * Every path returns rather than throws, exactly as `lib/alerts/record.ts`
 * does and for the same reason: the caller is already in a failure, and a
 * reporter that throws turns one broken screen into two.
