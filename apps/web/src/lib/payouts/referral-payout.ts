/**
 * THE REWARDS BALANCE PAYOUT (D51): server action, webhook settlement, sweep.
 *
 * Order of events, every one of them server-side:
 *   1. the bank resolves the account name (never the member's typing);
 *   2. `rewards_payout_open` holds the available rewards in the append-only
 *      ledger and mints an idempotent reference, or routes to review;
 *   3. a Paystack transfer recipient and a transfer from the MARKETING FLOAT
 *      account's balance under that reference;
 *   4. "sent" once the transfer is initiated; PAID ONLY on the signed
 *      `transfer.success` webhook (`public.rewards_payout_webhook`), never on
 *      the transfer API's answer or `/transfer/verify` (D62). Failed only on
 *      the `transfer.failed`/`transfer.reversed` webhook or a staff decision;
 *      the sweep's verify alerts staff and releases nothing. A timeout is
 *      `unknown`, never `failed`.
 *
 * PAYOUTS ARE OFF BY DEFAULT. The float is Vallo's own money and must not be
 * the main Paystack balance, which holds customer settlement money. No
 * separate float account exists yet, so a withdrawal answers "not available
 * yet" and sends nothing unless BOTH hold: `PAYSTACK_FLOAT_SECRET_KEY` (the
 * float account's own key, never the main key) is set, and the dated policy
 * row in force has `payouts_enabled = true` (checked in
 * `rewards_payout_open`). The verify route still needs confirming against
 * Paystack's docs before that flag is turned on (see `referral-transfer.ts`).
 *
 * The webhook route (`app/api/paystack/webhook/route.ts`) hands every
 * `transfer.*` event for a `vallo-rw-` reference to `settleRewardsTransferEvent`.
