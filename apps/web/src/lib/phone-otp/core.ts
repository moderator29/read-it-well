/**
 * PHONE CONFIRMATION (V-50), THE PURE HALF. Client-safe: no I/O, no logging.
 *
 * The phone is the scarcity anchor: a mailbox costs nothing to multiply and a
 * working Nigerian SIM, tied to a registered identity by NIN-SIM linkage, does
 * not. So the product asks for a confirmed phone at the consequential moments,
 * and only at the first of each:
 *
 *   inspection  the first inspection request or visit slot (it costs an agent
 *               a Saturday)
 *   review      the first review, a stay review or a tenancy review alike
 *   report      the first report that is NOT about immediate danger. A report
 *               that somebody is unsafe is never delayed by a code, ever.
 *
 * And, by the founder's FULL GATE ruling (13 October 2026), before the first:
 *
 *   message     the first message that opens a new conversation. A reply in a
 *               thread somebody else started is never held, so a host can
 *               always answer and a call's "they have written here" holds.
 *   booking     the first stay booking, room request or table reservation
 *   payment     the first payment of any kind the member starts
 *   listing     the first listing a lister, host or restaurant publishes
 *
 * Browsing and saving stay open, and a member is never asked who they are: a
 * phone is not an ID. A QA account (public.qa_accounts) is never asked at all.
