/**
 * The welcome email: the first thing Vallo ever sends somebody unprompted.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Every other message in the catalogue answers something the
 * reader did: a booking, a payment, a code they asked for. This one answers
 * nothing. It arrives because a person confirmed their address, and it is the
 * first time Vallo speaks to them in their inbox, so it is written as a door
 * opening rather than a receipt: their name, what Vallo is in one sentence
 * worth reading, the two sides of the account, three first steps in their own
 * terms, and one lit button that takes them to `/welcome`, the first run
 * screen, whose "Two worlds. One platform." this message echoes.
 *
 * WHY IT HAS ITS OWN DOCUMENT RATHER THAN `compose`. The shared shell in
 * `render.ts` renders a closed set of blocks, which is right for a receipt and
 * too plain for this. The welcome needs the two world tiles, numbered step
 * plates, a lit button with a bright top edge and a bloom, and mobile stacking.
 * It is built INSIDE the same document as every other message
 * (`documentHtml` in `render.ts`: the navy brand band, the white card, the
 * footer with the support and legal links, the one style block with the dark
 * scheme) from the same palette (`theme.ts`), so it is visibly the same
 * family, and it satisfies every structural rule `shell.test.ts` holds the
 * whole catalogue to: tables only, one style block that nothing depends on,
 * every ground painted, one image (the lockup), a hidden inbox line, 600px
 * and fluid.
 *
 * WHO SENDS IT. Not this file. `lib/notify/welcome.ts` (`welcomeOnce`) sends
 * it once, on confirmation, guarded by `profiles.welcomed_at`, and picks the
 * version from `profiles.signup_role`. This file is the design and the
 * words.
 *
 * THE WORDS NEVER CLAIM WHAT NOBODY CAN STAND BEHIND. No counts, no promise
 * about what the platform holds, nothing insured or guaranteed, nothing
 * verified that is not. Every first step resolves to a route that exists, and
 * `welcome-message.test.ts` checks each one against the app directory.
