/**
 * The Vallo transactional email shell.
 *
 * ONE DESCRIPTION, TWO RENDERINGS.
 *
 * Every message in this system is written once, as a list of blocks, and this
 * module renders that list twice: as HTML for the client that can draw it, and
 * as plain text for the one that cannot. Nothing is written twice by hand,
 * which is the only way the two stay in step. A text alternative maintained
 * separately is a text alternative that is wrong within a month, and a wrong
 * one is worse than none: it is what a screen reader reads, what a text-only
 * client shows, and what a spam filter compares against the HTML.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A TEXT PART AT ALL, since almost every client renders HTML. A
 * message with no text/plain part scores worse with every major spam filter,
 * because a missing alternative is a bulk-mail signature. On a platform whose
 * emails carry a verification code and a wallet receipt, landing in spam is
 * not a cosmetic failure.
 *
 * WHITE IN LIGHT MODE, THE PRODUCT'S NIGHT IN DARK (D23, 6 October 2026,
 * superseding the dark-everywhere ruling of 29 September for the inline
 * layer). Every message is a white ground and one white card with a hairline
 * edge: the lockup and the slogan, the message's 3D object, the subject as
 * a display line, the consequence, the figure where there is money, the
 * detail as key-value rows with line glyphs, one primary button with its
 * address as a plain link beneath it, then the footer on the ground. Table
 * layout, every colour inline on the element it paints and repeated as a
 * `bgcolor` attribute for Outlook's Word engine.
 *
 * TWO REGISTERS (icons.ts `FAMILY`, theme.ts). Money and document mail is
 * PAPER: in a dark-mode client the ground goes navy and the card stays the
 * white document sheet (D28.1). Notification and lifecycle mail is the SHELL:
 * in a dark-mode client the card turns to the product's night. Both are white
 * in the inline layer, so a client that strips the style block, which is
 * Gmail, shows the light design every time.
 *
 * READABLE WHATEVER THE READER'S CLIENT DOES WITH DARK MODE. The document
 * declares `color-scheme: light dark`, so Apple Mail and iOS Mail apply the
 * designed dark scheme instead of inverting. Clients that run their own pass
 * anyway (Gmail's iOS app can invert a whole message) are handled by the
 * palette itself: every ink keeps AA against its ground both as written and
 * inverted. `theme.ts` carries the palette and the measurements, and
 * `email-dark-paint.test.ts` holds every message to it.
 *
 * NO WORDS IN IMAGES BEYOND THE BRAND'S OWN. The shell carries the lockup,
 * whose alt is the brand name, so with images off the reader sees "Vallo"
 * once, in its place; at most one 3D object above the headline
 * (`icons.ts`), whose alt is its family word; and 16px line glyphs in the
 * rows, decorative beside their labels, alt empty.
 * Every other word is live text. Copy baked into
 * a picture is unreadable with images off, which is the default in a large
 * share of inboxes, and unreadable to a screen reader always.
 *
 * NO EMOJI as section markers, headings or bullets. They render as tofu in
 * some clients, as a colour glyph the design did not choose in others, and
 * they are read aloud in full by a screen reader in the middle of a sentence
 * about money.
 *
 * Everything interpolated goes through escapeHtml first: listing titles, names
 * and references come from the database or a form, and a stray angle bracket
 * must never be able to reshape the markup.
 *
 * THE PALETTE, THE TYPE STACK AND THE MEASUREMENTS ALL LIVE IN `theme.ts`,
 * which is also what `scripts/build-auth-emails.mjs` mirrors, so the first
 * email somebody ever gets from Vallo and the twentieth are the same design.
 * That file explains at length why literal hex is correct in an email and must
 * not be "fixed" into a CSS custom property.

/**
 * EVERY SURFACE PAINTS ITS OWN GROUND, EXPLICITLY (track H, 25 September 2026).
 *
 * The shell's dark was carried by three layers: a `bgcolor` on the body and
 * the card, inline `background:` shorthands, and the `rm-*` classes under a
 * dark media query. Gmail strips the media query and runs its own dark pass,
 * Outlook's Word engine reads `bgcolor` and not the shorthand, and a cell with
 * no colour of its own takes whatever the client decides. So after a message
 * is composed, this walks every body, table, row and cell and makes the colour
 * explicit on each one, in BOTH forms every client honours:
 *
 *   - its own colour, from `background-color`, `background:` or `bgcolor`,
 *     written out as a `bgcolor` attribute AND an inline `background-color`;
 *   - or, where it has none, its container's colour, written the same way.
 *
 * So no cell ever relies on a class, and nothing inherits a white from the
 * client.
 *
 * AND THE GROUND CLASS TRAVELS WITH THE GROUND (29 September 2026). The
 * style block re-asserts the palette by class for the clients that restyle
 * by scheme, so a cell that inherits its colour also inherits the container's
 * `rm-base`, `rm-card`, `rm-panel` or `rm-head` class, and the two are always
 * repainted together rather than a cell being left behind. The mirror of this function lives in `scripts/build-auth-emails.mjs`
 * (a Node script that cannot import TypeScript); `email-dark-paint.test.ts`
 * checks the output of both.

 *      the sheet classes held at paper, so a receipt stays a document on the
 *      dark desk (D28.1). The hairlines inside a shell card turn to the
 *      night's own edge with it, so a white rule never cuts a navy card.
 *      Under `light` the inline palette is re-asserted.
 *   3. OUTLOOK.COM runs its own dark pass and marks each element it repainted
 *      with `data-ogsb` (ground) or `data-ogsc` (ink). The rules keyed on them
 *      put the designed dark back, so its guess never replaces the design.
 *   4. A phone gets tighter card padding.
