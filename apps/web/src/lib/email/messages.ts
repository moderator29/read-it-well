/**
 * The Vallo transactional email catalogue.
 *
 * One function per message, each taking typed data and returning a subject, an
 * HTML body and a plain text alternative. Nothing here reads the environment
 * beyond the site URL used for links, and nothing here sends: a message is a
 * pure value, so it can be inspected, diffed and tested without a network.
 *
 * Both renderings come from ONE description. A message is a list of blocks and
 * `compose` renders them twice, so the text alternative cannot drift out of
 * step with the HTML the way a hand-maintained second copy always does. See
 * render.ts.
 *
 * COPY RULES, ALL BINDING.
 *
 *   British spelling. Plain and calm: the tone of a platform that tells you
 *   what happened and what happens next, and then stops.
 *
 *   No marketing. Nobody opens a receipt to be sold to. There is no
 *   "we are excited", no "amazing", no exclamation mark, and no claim this
 *   platform cannot stand behind.
 *
 *   No em dash characters, anywhere.
 *
 *   No emoji. Not as a section marker, not as a bullet, not in a subject line.
 *
 *   Money always through `money()`, so integer kobo can never reach a reader.
 *
 *   A name is always greeted through `hello()`, which cannot produce
 *   "Hello ,". Every function here takes the name as optional for that reason:
 *   the absence of a name is an ordinary state and not an error.
 *
 *   Safety guidance rides on the messages where somebody is about to move
 *   money or meet a stranger, and nowhere else. A warning on every email is a
 *   warning nobody reads.
