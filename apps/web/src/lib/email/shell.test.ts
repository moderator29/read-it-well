 * message IS: a piece of HTML that has to survive Outlook's Word engine,
 * Gmail's rewriting, a phone at 360px and an inbox with images switched off,
 * and it checks the five Supabase auth templates by the same rules, because
 * those are the first email anybody ever gets and they used to be a different
 * design from everything after them.
 *
 * Every failure here has happened to a real email system:
 *
 *   a stylesheet link that the client stripped, leaving unstyled text;
 *   a flex container that Outlook rendered as one column of nothing;
 *   copy baked into an image, invisible in the half of inboxes that block them;
 *   an alt attribute repeating text that was already on the page;
 *   a hand-edited template that the generator then silently overwrote;
 *   a palette that drifted between two files nobody diffed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT CHECK, and it is worth being blunt about it: no test here
 * proves an email looks right in Outlook 2016, or arrives at all. There is no
 * mail client and no sending key in this environment. What is provable is the
 * markup, the palette, the copy rules and the fact that the generated files
 * match their generator, and that is what is here.
