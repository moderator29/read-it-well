 * impossible to keep by hand across a catalogue that grows. Each one below has
 * been broken by a real email system at some point, which is the only reason
 * it is worth a test:
 *
 *   an inbox preview line that was never set, so the client shows the first
 *   forty characters of markup;
 *   a template that renders "Hello ," because a name was blank;
 *   a text alternative that was forgotten on the newest message and only that
 *   one, which is exactly the message that then lands in spam;
 *   an em dash that arrived by autocorrect.
 *
 * Everything is exercised through the real functions with real data, so the
 * assertions are about output rather than about implementation.
