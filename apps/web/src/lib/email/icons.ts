/**
 * THE OBJECT IN EVERY EMAIL'S HEADER, AND THE GLYPHS IN ITS ROWS (north star
 * 16.5 and D23).
 *
 * THE FOUNDER'S ORIGINAL 3D OBJECTS. Each message carries one of the founder's
 * 30 September 3D objects (royal blue clay, one orange accent), the same art
 * `Icon3D` draws in the product, chosen per message for what the message is
 * about (an envelope for a code, a contract for an agreement), the way an app
 * icon sits beside a notification. For a few days on 6 October 2026 these
 * were swapped for the matte "tier B" set; the founder asked for the original
 * 3D icons back, so they are back.
 *
 * PNG, NEVER WEBP. The site serves the cutouts as webp, which classic Outlook,
 * older Apple Mail and several webmails do not draw. The email copies are PNGs
 * in `public/brand/3d/email/<name>.png` (128px, drawn at 64, so every screen
 * gets 2x) beside `<name>@2x.png` (256px), cut from the same sources as the
 * webp files (`icon3dEmailSrc` in `components/ui/icon-3d.ts`).
 *
 * THE RECEIPT IS NEVER USED HERE: it carries a "$" coin, and Vallo's mail is
 * in naira.
 *
 * THE ALT IS THE FAMILY, A WORD (north star 16.5: "every image carries alt
 * text and a sensible fallback"). With images off the reader sees "Payment"
 * or "Account" in quiet type where the object would be, in a box of the
 * object's size, and the headline under it does the rest. A family word and
 * not the headline, so a screen reader does not read the subject twice.
 *
 * THE LINE GLYPHS in the key-value rows are the product's own UiIcon line
 * tier (stroke on a 24 grid, the family blue), rendered once to PNG at 3x
 * and drawn at 16px. They are decorative beside a label that says the same
 * thing, so their alt is empty: with images off the row is its words.
 *
 * The five Supabase auth templates (`scripts/build-auth-emails.mjs`, not this
 * module) carry the same 3D marks from `public/brand/3d/email/`.
