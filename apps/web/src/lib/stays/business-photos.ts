/**
 * Photographs on the business spine, read.
 *
 * `business_photos` is the restaurant's answer to `accommodation_photos`
 * (migration `20260919220000_p3_a_restaurant_can_carry_photographs`): up to
 * ten rows per business, position 0 is the cover, and `storage_path` is a path
 * inside the PUBLIC `accommodation-photos` bucket rather than a URL.
 *
 * THE BUCKET IS SHARED AND THAT IS DELIBERATE, so there is exactly one place
 * in the application that turns a stored path into a URL. `accommodationPhotoUrl`
 * is that place; `businessPhotoUrl` is a named door onto it so a reader of a
 * restaurant surface is not left wondering whether the wrong bucket has been
 * used. The migration's header carries the full argument, including the one
 * that settled it: a second bucket would have been invisible to the account
 * deletion purge until somebody remembered to add it.
 *
 * Every read goes through the caller's own RLS-bound client and asks.
 * `business_photos_select` answers: anybody may read the photographs of a
 * PUBLISHED business, the owner may read their own whatever its status, and an
 * admin may read any. Nothing here re-states that rule, and nothing here
 * throws: a failed read is no photographs, which every surface already draws
 * honestly with a category plate and a "No photographs yet" chip.
