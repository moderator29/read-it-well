/**
 * THE DECIDE-BY LIST, AS PURE DATA (C3, 30 September 2026).
 *
 * Every request a host still has to answer, with the moment it stops being
 * answerable, sorted by the time left. Two kinds today, each with its own
 * honest deadline:
 *
 *   room request   lapses HOLD_WINDOW_HOURS (48) after it was made, when
 *                  `expire_booking_holds` cancels it and gives the nights back.
 *   table request  is moot at the table's own time: the board files an
 *                  unanswered table under "past" once its moment has gone.
 *
 * THE CLOCK SPEAKS THE SUPPORT DESK'S LANGUAGE (docs/SUPPORT_STAFF.md, "The
 * promise and the clock"): blue with time to spare, cyan (the platform's
 * "pending") in the last quarter of the window, red in the last hour, and "Lapsed" once it has gone. The
 * colour is never the only signal: every chip says the time left in words.
