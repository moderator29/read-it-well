 * Host onboarding input schemas.

 * Every field is optional on the draft schema and that is deliberate: the
 * wizard saves after every step, so a save must never refuse a half-filled
 * application. What each field must LOOK LIKE when present is checked here,
 * once, with the same rules the database's own CHECKs carry, so a person is
 * told about a malformed CAC number beside the box rather than by a refusal
 * after ten more minutes of typing. What must be PRESENT to submit is
 * `missingFrom`'s job, not this file's.
 *
 * THE WORDS ARE THE HOST'S (C9). Each schema is built from the messages in
 * `experienceHost.refusals.schema`, which the server action reads in the
 * request's locale (`hostRefusals()`), so a Hausa, Yoruba or Igbo host reads
 * the sentence beside the box in their own language. Built per call: zod
 * bakes a custom message into the schema, and a request is one locale.
