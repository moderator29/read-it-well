/**
 * Host onboarding, as a model rather than as ten screens.
 *
 * The twin of components/verification/kyc.ts, for the same reason: the flow
 * branches. A restaurant answers a service-and-seating step that a hotel
 * never sees, a CAC-registered business answers a registration step an
 * individual never sees, so "step 4 of 9" is not a constant. Everything
 * about which steps exist, in what order, and what is still missing lives
 * here, pure, and the screens render it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE KNOWS THAT kyc.ts DID NOT: where it is stored. The
 * businesses row is the application (docs/research/HOST_ONBOARDING_RESEARCH.md
 * section 3.2), created as DRAFT at step two and written onto under owner
 * RLS by lib/host/actions.ts. `HostDraft` is the read-back of that row and
 * its children, shaped for `missingFrom`, and `missingFrom` is the one
 * function that decides whether the review step may submit. It returns the
 * list rather than a boolean so the review screen can PRINT what is absent.
 *
 * Client-safe: imports nothing server-only, so the wizard and the server
 * action read the same rules.
