 * scopes through `private.owns_business` or `private.owns_accommodation`, so
 * another host's application simply does not come back. Nothing here uses the

 *
 * NEITHER READ EVER THROWS UPWARDS. The wizard renders whatever happens here:
 * a failed read comes back as an empty draft rather than as an error screen,
 * because the draft the person is typing lives in the browser until it is
 * saved and a crash would be the one way to lose it.
 *
 * The one exception is a draft whose private fields (contact, registration,
 * consents) could not be read. An empty wizard over a business that has them
 * would save blanks over the real values, so `readMyHostDraft` says
 * "unavailable" and the wizard is not drawn.

 * THE BEDROOMS AND BEDS A ROOM TYPE RECORDS.

 * THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY "`room_types.beds` has no shape constraint" AND
 * THAT WAS FALSE. The column has carried
 * `room_types_beds_check (jsonb_typeof(beds) = ''array'')` since it was
 * created, with the shape written on the line above it in
 * `20260918081453_m04_room_types_units_rate_plans_rate_calendar.sql`. The
 * sentence was inherited rather than checked, the shortlet screen was written
 * from it and wrote an OBJECT, and the probe that should have caught that
 * asserted a round trip BECAUSE of this sentence. Every real save would have
 * failed with `23514`. **A comment asserting an absence is exactly as
 * unverified as a test asserting a presence**, and this file now asserts
 * neither: `bedsTotal` reads what is there and the probe asks the database.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL UNCONSTRAINED, precisely. The column must be an ARRAY. What is
 * IN the array is not checked by anything: the schema's own comment says the
 * entries are "validated in the app" and no schema in this repository
 * validates them, which is a second unbacked claim and is named in the ledger.
 * So every entry is read defensively and nothing here throws, because a
 * malformed row must not take down the step that would let somebody fix it.
 *
 * `bedrooms` IS ITS OWN COLUMN, added by
 * `20260922200000_imgc_a_bedroom_is_not_a_bed.sql`, because a bedroom is not a
 * bed and can only enter that array as a fake entry. Null while that migration
 * has not run, and null for every hotel room type, which has never been asked.
