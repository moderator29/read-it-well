/**
 * Finding a person.
 *
 * **`/u/[handle]` answered for every handle and nothing answered for none of
 * them.** A handle was reachable only if you already knew it, which made the
 * follow graph a feature you could only use on people you had already met, and
 * it is the same criticism `SOCIAL_DESIGN.md` levelled at the follow graph it
 * originally cut. Every profile link on the platform assumed you already knew
 * the name.
 *
 * **Two ways in: a name or a handle.** Occupation and place used to be two
 * more, searched for everybody; they are a member's own facts and are shown
 * only where that member published them (V-64), and searched by nobody.
 *
 * **`citext` is not installed**, and this is exactly where that bites. Every
 * comparison here is `ilike`, on the profile columns and on both reference
 * tables, rather than an equality that would quietly find only the people who
 * typed their name the way you did.
 *
 * **There is no block check here and there must not be.**
 * `social_profiles_select` carries `not private.blocked_with(user_id)`, so
 * anybody a block touches in either direction is already absent from every
 * answer below. A second check would be a second place for it to be wrong.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. A directory that 500s because one reference lookup was
 * slow is worse than one that is briefly short.
