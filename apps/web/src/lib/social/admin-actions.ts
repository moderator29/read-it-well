/**
 * The console's hands on Around.
 *
 * Two owner rulings live here and nowhere else, so this is the only file that
 * can grant either of them:
 *
 *   A place proposed by a person becomes public only when an admin says so.
 *   A member becomes a moderator only when an admin says so.
 *
 * Neither can happen from a member-facing screen. The `areas` insert policy
 * pins a new row to PROPOSED, and the `area_members` insert policy pins a new
 * row to MEMBER, so the promotion in both cases has to come through an admin
 * policy. That is deliberate: a role that a screen could grant is a role that a
 * bug could grant.
 *
 * Same two-client split the rest of the console already uses. The record being
 * decided is written through the admin's own RLS-bound client so Postgres
 * re-checks the role on every mutation. The service role does only the three
 * things no user-bound client may do: append to the append-only audit log,
 * write a notification into somebody else's row, and set a role.
