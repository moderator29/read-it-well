 * THE MESSAGE BUTTON ON A PROFILE (founder, 11 October 2026). Pure, so it is
 * tested rather than trusted.
 *
 * `social_profiles.contact_policy` is OPEN ("Anyone can message me") or
 * REQUEST ("Ask me first", the default). The rule:
 *
 *   the owner's own profile    no Message button, ever
 *   OPEN                       the Message button, for anybody
 *   REQUEST, viewer follows    the Message button
 *   REQUEST, viewer does not   no button; the profile says "Follow to
 *                              message" beside Follow instead
 *
 * Following is the ask. Once the viewer follows, the page refreshes (the
 * Follow button does that) and the button is there. The same rule guards
 * `/u/<handle>/message` and the send itself, for somebody with no chat with
 * the person yet, so typing the address does not get round a hidden button.
 * A signed-out viewer follows nobody, so a REQUEST profile asks them to
 * follow, and Follow sends them to sign in first.
