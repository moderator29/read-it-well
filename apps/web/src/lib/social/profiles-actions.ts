/**
 * Claiming a handle, and editing the profile behind it.
 *
 * The write goes through the person's OWN row level security bound client.
 * `social_profiles_insert_self` and `social_profiles_update_self` decide that
 * the row is theirs, and neither rule is restated here, because a rule enforced
 * in two places drifts in one of them.
 *
 * Three things the database does that this file deliberately does not:
 *
 *   The handle trigger normalises, checks the charset, refuses a reserved word
 *   or anything resembling an official RentMe name, and refuses a handle
 *   released inside the last 90 days. It raises RM001, RM002 and RM003, each
 *   with a sentence already written for a person to read, so this file maps the
 *   code to the field and passes the sentence straight through rather than
 *   inventing a second copy of the rule.
 *
 *   The scanner holds a bio or link carrying a ten digit run or payment
 *   language, setting bio_status to HELD before the row is ever visible. This
 *   file reads the resulting status back and hands it to the surface so the
 *   author is told honestly. It never sets that column itself.
 *
 *   The counters are maintained by triggers. Nothing here touches
 *   follower_count, following_count or post_count.
