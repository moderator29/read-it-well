/**
 * Following, and unfollowing.
 *
 * One row in `public.follows` written through the person's OWN row level
 * security bound client. Three rules live in the database and none of them is
 * restated here, because a rule enforced in two places drifts in one of them:
 *
 *   `follows_insert_self` decides that the follower is you, that the followee
 *   has actually claimed a handle, and that neither of you has blocked the
 *   other. That last clause is `private.blocked_with`, which is bidirectional.
 *
 *   `follows_delete_self` decides that you may only ever remove your own
 *   follow.
 *
 *   `private.bump_follow_counts` maintains `follower_count` and
 *   `following_count` on both profiles. **Nothing in application code touches a
 *   count.** The number handed back to the surface is read again afterwards, in
 *   its own statement, because a statement cannot see the rows its own trigger
 *   has just written.
 *
 * The action takes a handle rather than a user id: a handle is the address the
 * person is looking at, and resolving it server side means a crafted form
 * cannot point a follow at somebody the viewer cannot even see.
