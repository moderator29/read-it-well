/**
 * @vallo in the replies.
 *
 * Somebody names the assistant in a post and it answers, once, as a row in
 * `public.posts` with `author_kind = 'BOT'` and a null author. That is the whole
 * architecture and it is the reason the single-table decision was made: the
 * reply can be liked, reposted, quote-reposted, replied to and reported with no
 * special casing anywhere, because to every one of those paths it is a post.
 *
 * **Four rules this file exists to keep.**
 *
 * 1. **It never holds a service role for reading.** The listing search runs
 *    through the ordinary repository, the same one `/search` uses, so the model
 *    only ever sees rows a signed-out visitor could see. The admin client
 *    appears exactly twice: to ask `private.bot_may_run`, which is granted to
 *    nobody else, and to write a row whose `author_kind` no policy will accept
 *    from a person. `posts_insert_self` demands `author_id = auth.uid()` and
 *    `author_kind = 'USER'`, correctly, so a bot reply cannot come from the
 *    caller's client and should not.
 *
 * 2. **A refusal is a reply, not a silence.** Off, over the month, over the day,
 *    over your own allowance: each one is posted in the assistant's own voice.
 *    A summon that answers once and then goes quiet reads as a broken product.
 *    One that says "not today" reads as a paused one, and this platform has just
 *    spent two rounds removing controls that did nothing quietly.
 *
 * 3. **Every call is priced and recorded**, with its real token counts, into
 *    `bot_invocations.cost_minor`. That column is what `bot_may_run` sums
 *    against the ceilings, so a call that records zero is a ceiling that does
 *    not exist. A refusal is recorded too, at zero cost with its reason, because
 *    the shape of what was refused is the only way to know whether a ceiling is
 *    set sensibly.
 *
 * 4. **One reply per summon, for ever.** Checked against the thread rather than
 *    remembered, so two taps, two tabs or a retry cannot produce two answers,
 *    and so a person past the ceiling cannot turn a refusal into a way to fill a
 *    thread with the bot saying no.
 *
 * The scanner still runs on the bot's own words, because `posts_scan` is a
 * BEFORE trigger and the admin client does not skip triggers. If the assistant
 * ever writes something that looks like an account number, it is held like
 * anybody else's post. That is deliberate.

/*
 * **The gate has a door now.** `private.bot_may_run` could not be reached over
 * PostgREST at all, because PostgREST exposes `public` only and a function in
 * `private` therefore has no endpoint: `consume_rate_limit` and
 * `claim_idempotency` are reachable because each has a thin `public` wrapper,
 * and this one had none. That was caught by reading `pg_proc` rather than by
 * trusting a generated type, which could never have said so. `public.bot_may_run`
 * now exists as a one line security definer delegate, `authenticated` and
 * `service_role` may execute it and `anon` may not, and the call below is an
 * ordinary typed `rpc` again with no escape hatch anywhere in this file.
 *
 * **A failure is still treated as a refusal rather than as permission.**
 * Everywhere else in this platform an infrastructure failure fails OPEN,
 * deliberately, because a rate limiter that blocks a real person during a wobble
 * is worse than one that misses a count. This gate is different in kind: behind
 * it is a paid API and a monthly ceiling, so an unreachable gate is a closed
 * gate. The reason is recorded distinctly, so "the ceiling is reached" and "the
 * gate could not be asked" never look the same in `bot_invocations`.
