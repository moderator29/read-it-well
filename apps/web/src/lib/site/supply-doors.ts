/**
 * A9. THE FRONT DOOR FOR SUPPLY, AS DATA: `/for-agents`, `/for-hosts` and
 * `/for-landlords`.
 *
 * "Become an agent" used to redirect a stranger to a sign-in wall with no
 * word about what listing costs, what is looked at, or how payouts arrive.
 * These three pages say it, and every fact is read from the module that
 * enforces it rather than written again:
 *
 *   the steps        `lib/supply/registration.ts` (the four screens per role)
 *                    and `lib/host/doors.ts` (the three stays doors);
 *   what is looked at  `lib/trust/verification.ts` (the four rungs, with the
 *                    evidence a reviewer looks at);
 *   money            `lib/money/copy.ts`, the one source for every sentence
 *                    about money, and the live rates (`lister-fees.ts`);
 *   stays refunds    `lib/trust/cancellation.ts`.
 *
 * English only for now, like `/safety` and `/standards`; the three languages
 * follow when the public site gets its locale paths (A10).
 *
 * THE CLAIMS RULE. No page says a person is "verified" by signing up: the
 * ladder is described as what a reviewer looks at, and what Vallo does NOT do
 * is stated beside it.
