/**
 * THE ONE FAILURE NOTHING IN THIS FOLDER COULD SEE: a job that has STOPPED.
 *
 * Everything else here is watched. A job that throws is a 500, an audit row
 * and a critical alert; a job that finds something raises the alert its
 * verdict asked for; a job that runs clean leaves a dated row so the history
 * is readable. All of that depends on the job RUNNING. A schedule that was
 * never deployed, a cron entry deleted in a config edit, a secret rotated on
 * one side only, a project paused: in every one of those the job simply never
 * fires, and a job that never fires raises nothing at all. It is the quietest
 * failure a platform has, and the only trace of it is an absence, which is
 * exactly the thing nobody notices.
 *
 * `lib/cron/report.ts` already writes the fact that would show it: one
 * `audit_log` row per run under `entity_type = 'cron_job'`. Until now
 * somebody had to go and look. This reads those rows on a schedule and says
 * the absence out loud.
 *
 * IT ONLY EVER COMPLAINS ABOUT A JOB THAT USED TO RUN. A job with no history
 * at all is a deploy that has not happened yet, a preview environment, or the
 * first hour of a new job's life, and alerting on those would put four rows on
 * the desk every hour of the first day, which is how a desk gets ignored. The
 * envelope still counts them, so a job that has NEVER run is visible to
 * anybody reading the run's output without being pushed at a person at 3am.
 *
 * Pure decision, injected clock, no query: `staleJobs` is the whole rule and a
 * test drives every branch of it. `readLastRuns` is the one read.

 *
 * `/api/paystack/reconcile` USED TO BE DELIBERATELY ABSENT from this list,
 * because it writes its run history through `recordMoneyAudit` as
 * `wallet.reconciliation.run` against `wallet_entry` rather than as a
 * `cron_job` row, and this watch could not see that shape. The note said
 * whoever unified the two writers would add the line.
 *
 * NOBODY DID, AND HERE IS WHAT IT COST, MEASURED ON 22 SEPTEMBER 2026 AGAINST
 * THE LIVE DATABASE. `public.audit_log` holds 474 `wallet.reconciliation.run`
 * rows and the most recent is dated 29 AUGUST. `cron.job_run_details` for the
 * hourly database job reports `succeeded, 1 row` every hour, including at
 * 12:47 today. `net._http_response` holds six responses from today, 07:47
 * through 12:47, and every one of them is a 404 reading
 * `The deployment could not be found on Vercel. DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND`: the
 * origin in Vault points at a per-deployment URL that no longer exists rather
 * than at the stable production alias.
 *
 * So the ONLY job on this platform that recovers a charge whose webhook never
 * arrived has been dead for over three weeks, the scheduler has reported
 * success every hour of it, a platform survey recorded that the job succeeds,
 * and nothing anywhere raised, because the one thing that could have raised
 * was this list and it had been told to look at the wrong table.
 *
 * It is watched now, by the shape it actually writes. The origin itself is the
 * founder's to fix in Vault; what this closes is the silence.
 *
 * `/api/cron/account-purge` reports through `lib/cron/report.ts` exactly as
 * the rows below do and is NOT watched. That is a gap rather than a decision:
 * it was scheduled after this list was written and nobody added the line. It
 * belongs to whoever owns that job, and it is recorded here so the absence is
 * a known one rather than an invisible one.
 *
 * This list is not a count of the cron entries and must not be read as one.
