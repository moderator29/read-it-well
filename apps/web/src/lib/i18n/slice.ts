 * A CLIENT COMPONENT GETS THE PART OF THE DICTIONARY IT READS (Track M

 *
 * A server page that hands `t` to a `"use client"` component serialises all of
 * it into the page: 365 KB of every surface's words, in the HTML and in the
 * payload of the navigation. A listing card reads three namespaces of it.
 * Each slice below names what one client component (and the children it
 * passes `t` to) reads, and `slice-coverage.test.ts` re-reads those files and
 * fails the build if one starts reading a namespace its slice does not carry.
 *
 * The slices are cached per dictionary object, so thirty cards on a page are
 * handed the SAME object and React sends it once, and a request costs no more
 * than a map lookup. The dictionaries are module constants, so the cache is
 * bounded by the four locales.

 * namespace as a whole, which `slice-coverage.test.ts` checks key by key.
