 * THE SLICES MUST COVER EVERYTHING THEIR COMPONENT CAN REACH.
 *
 * A client component hands its `t` to helpers and children that read it under
 * other names (`dictionary.units`, `copy.catalogue`), so reading the
 * component's own file is not enough: the listing card reached `units` through
 * a helper and a smoke run caught it where this test, as first written, did
 * not. So this walks the component's WHOLE local import graph and counts any
 * `.name` or `["name"]` that is a top-level dictionary namespace, anywhere in
 * it. That over-approximates on purpose: a slice that carries one namespace
 * too many costs a few kilobytes, one that carries one too few is a crash.
