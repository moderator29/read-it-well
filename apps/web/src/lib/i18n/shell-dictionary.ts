/**
 * THE SHELL'S SLICE OF THE DICTIONARY (Track M performance, 25 September 2026).
 *
 * `AppShell` is a client component, so whatever the (app) layout hands it as
 * `t` is serialised into the page. It was handed the WHOLE dictionary: every
 * string of every surface, 365 KB of JSON, in the HTML of every first load,
 * when the header, the drawer, the dock and the switch read a small part of
 * it. The founder asked for an app that loads fast with no "booting"; this was
 * the single largest thing every page carried for no reader.
 *
 * The first cut sent whole namespaces (58 KB), found by an import walker that
 * also counted `t.nav.settings` as the `settings` namespace. This one is
 * typed: `AppShell` and everything it hands `t` to take a `ShellDictionary`,
 * so the compiler refuses any read that is not carried here, and the shell
 * carries only the lines it draws (about 4 KB; the test holds it under 8).
 * A full dictionary still fits wherever a `ShellDictionary` is asked for, so
 * the previews and the admin console that pass one need no change.
