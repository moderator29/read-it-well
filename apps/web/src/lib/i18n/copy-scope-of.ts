/**
 * THE WORDS A ROUTE HANDS ITS CLIENT ISLANDS (Session 3, W13).
 *
 * A `"use client"` component that called `getDictionary(locale)` shipped the
 * whole `@vallo/i18n` index in its route's first load: 1,351,758 bytes raw,
 * 398,654 gzipped, measured on the production build, on every money route
 * (checkout, rent pay, the payment methods, the money lock), the host wizard,
 * the agent's bookings and the support pages. The words those components use
 * are a few small namespaces (checkout is 2.8KB gzipped, success 1.9KB).
 *
 * So the server page, which already holds the dictionary, picks the slices
 * its islands need with `copyScopeOf(t, [...])` and renders them inside
 * `<CopyScope>` (`copy-scope.tsx`); the islands read `useScopedCopy(key)`.
 * Only the picked words cross into the page, and the bundle carries none.
 *
 * Type-only import of the dictionary shape, so this module is safe on both
 * sides and costs the client nothing.
