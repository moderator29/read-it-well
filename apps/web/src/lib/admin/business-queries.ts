/**
 * The stays business approval queue.
 *
 * The `listings` queue's sibling, on the same frame: search, status chips
 * bound to the real enum, a Lagos date range, and a pager pushed into the
 * query rather than applied to a page of rows already fetched
 * (`lib/admin/queue-filter.ts` is the argument for all four).
 *
 * WHAT A REVIEWER ACTUALLY NEEDS IN FRONT OF THEM, per
 * docs/research/HOST_ONBOARDING_RESEARCH.md section 3.4: the business fields,
 * the uploaded documents opened in place, the CAC number and
 * registered name to compare against the free public search, the resolved
 * bank name beside the identity and business names, the rungs already
 * recorded, and whether the property is actually publishable (a cover photo
 * and the pin, MK-55). A decision taken without those is a tick, not a review.
 *
 * THE PRIVATE BUCKET IS THE POINT, exactly as in kyc-queries.ts:
 * host-documents is private because these objects are driving licences and
 * CAC certificates. It used to hand the reviewer a short-lived signed URL,
 * which the desk then opened in a tab on `supabase.co`. It hands out no URL
 * at all now: see `app/api/documents/[id]/route.ts`.
 *
 * Reads go through the service role, but only after `requireAdmin` has passed
 * inside this module, the same shape `bookings-queries.ts` uses: the console
 * sees every application, which is the point of a review desk.
