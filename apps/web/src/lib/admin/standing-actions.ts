/**
 * Granting standing by hand, and taking it back.
 *
 * top_contributor is the one badge on this platform a person awards rather
 * than a trigger. `badges.manual_only` says so and, since the people, places
 * and standing migration, the database enforces it: a manual badge whose
 * granted_by is null is refused with RM021, so a grant always names the admin
 * who made it and nothing can quietly award one from code.
 *
 * That is also what makes the surface honest. `user_badges.granted_by` being
 * null is the platform's definition of earned, so a badge with a name against
 * it is shown as granted, with the grantor and the reason, rather than being
 * presented as something the holder won.
 *
 * The write goes through the admin's own RLS-bound client (user_badges_admin_write
 * re-checks the role in Postgres), and only the audit row uses the service
 * role, because the audit log takes no client writes by design.
