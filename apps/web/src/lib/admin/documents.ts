/**
 * The one place a reviewer's document comes from.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLOSES. Three review desks used to hand the browser a signed
 * Supabase Storage URL in an anchor with `target="_blank"`. An operator
 * opening somebody's NIN, passport or driving licence therefore read it on
 * `<project>.supabase.co`: a third party origin, in a tab that is not ours,
 * under a content security policy that is not ours, recorded in the browser's
 * own history and disc cache, and with the signed URL itself sitting in our
 * DOM where anything on the page could read it and anybody could forward it.
 *
 * Rule 16 forbids logging or pasting a NIN or a document number. A document
 * somebody trusted us with is the same rule read whole: it is not handed to a
 * new tab, and it does not leave our chrome.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES IT. The signed URL is never minted for the browser at all.
 * The queue tells the page a document EXISTS and what shape it is; the bytes
 * come back through `/api/documents/<id>` on our own origin, with the service
 * role doing the fetch behind `requireAdmin`, and they are never cached.
 *
 * TWO TABLES, ONE DOOR. `agent_documents` in the private `agent-documents`
 * bucket is what the verification desk and the agent applications desk both
 * read. `business_documents` in `host-documents` is the stays side. The id is
 * a uuid from one table or the other, so the resolver asks each in turn and
 * the caller never has to know which desk it came from.
