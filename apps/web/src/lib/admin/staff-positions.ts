/**
 * NAMED STAFF POSITIONS AND THEIR JOB DESCRIPTIONS.
 *
 * A super admin grants a position, which sets its default bundle of scopes in
 * one step (they may still adjust individual scopes). The same list lives in
 * `private.staff_position_title` / `private.staff_position_scopes`
 * (migration `20260929094459_named_staff_positions_with_default_scope_bundles`);
 * `staff-positions.test.ts` reads that migration and fails if the two drift.
 *
 * Each position carries its job description: what the position is, what it is
 * responsible for, what is expected of the person in it, and where they take
 * what they cannot decide. It is linked from the access email and shown in the
 * console beside the staff handbook, so a staff member can always read back
 * exactly what their role covers.
 *
 * Client-safe: data only.
