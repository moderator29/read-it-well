/**
 * Recording a rung on an agent's verification ladder.
 *
 * One rung, one decision, one row. The tier itself is never written here: a
 * database trigger recomputes `agents.verification_tier` from the rungs that
 * have actually passed, so the number a guest eventually sees can only ever be
 * the sum of decisions somebody made, never a figure typed into a form.
 *
 * The write goes through the admin's own RLS-bound client, so Postgres
 * re-checks the role on the mutation rather than trusting a page that already
 * checked. The audit line and the agent's notification are the service role's
 * work, because the audit log has no insert policy for anybody and
 * `notifications` has no client insert policy at all, both deliberately.
 *
 * Both of those are best effort and happen after the decision has committed. A
 * failed log line or a failed notification must not turn a completed, correct
 * decision into an error the operator cannot act on.
