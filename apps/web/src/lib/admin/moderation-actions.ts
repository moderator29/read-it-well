/**
 * Releasing and removing what the scanner is holding.
 *
 * Four kinds of held thing, two decisions each: let it through, or take it
 * down. Every decision goes through one database function,
 * `public.moderation_decide`, called with the caller's own client, which
 * checks the moderation scope on auth.uid(), changes the row only while it
 * is HELD and writes the audit row in the same transaction. The tables'
 * update guards accept the change only when it comes through that function
 * (`private.may_moderate`, migration 20260929012228).
 *
 * Notifications are NOT written here. Every one of these four transitions
 * already fans out from a database trigger, which is the right place for it:
 * the notification then follows the row wherever it is changed from, including
 * from SQL at three in the morning, rather than following one code path.
