 * rows and nothing else, so the answer comes from the database rather than from
 * a cookie, a header or anything the browser can forge.
 *
 * The outcomes are deliberately four, not two. "Unconfigured" means the owner
 * has not added the platform keys yet, which is not a failure and must never
 * crash a page. "Signed out" asks for a sign in. "Not admin" is an honest, calm
 * refusal, never a blank screen and never a 404 that pretends the console does
 * not exist. Only the last outcome carries a client and a user.
