 * Proving it is still you, immediately before the account is deactivated.

 * WHY A DETACHED CLIENT. Verifying a password means asking GoTrue to sign in,
 * and the request-bound client in `lib/supabase/server.ts` writes its session
 * to the cookie store. Re-authenticating through that client would rotate the
 * live session as a side effect of a check. So this file builds its own client
 * over the public anon key with `persistSession: false` and
 * `autoRefreshToken: false`: it can ask GoTrue the question and it cannot
 * touch the caller's cookies, whatever the answer is.
 *
 * TWO METHODS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF ACCOUNT. Somebody who signed up
 * with an address and a password re-types the password. Somebody who signed in
 * with Google or Apple has never set one, and asking them for a password they
 * do not have would be the dead end this whole piece of work exists to remove,
 * so they get a one-time code at the address on the account instead.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS LOGGED. Not the address, not the password, not the code, not
 * the outcome keyed to a person. The caller records only that
 * re-authentication succeeded or failed, against an opaque uuid.
