/**
 * Account deletion, as a flow rather than as a call.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS "use server", SO IT EXPORTS ASYNC FUNCTIONS AND NOTHING ELSE.
 * Not a constant, not a type, not a re-export. Every value the screens need
 * lives in `constants.ts`, `preconditions.ts` or `queries.ts`. Section 10.7 of
 * the ledger records what the other mistake costs: twenty minutes of
 * production, in this build.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. `lib/profile/actions.ts` called
 * `admin.auth.admin.deleteUser`, which aborts on the first row whose foreign
 * key is `on delete restrict`, which is every booking and every wallet. So
 * anybody who had ever paid for anything was told to email support, which is
 * the case App Store Review guideline 5.1.1(v) names as a rejection. See
 * `docs/design/audits/r3/findings.md` F-17.
 *
 * THE FLOW, IN ORDER, AND EVERY STEP IS A REFUSAL POINT.
 *
 *   1. The preconditions are re-asked in the database, not trusted from the
 *      screen, so a booking made in another tab a second ago still blocks.
 *   2. The person re-authenticates: the password, or a one-time code for an
 *      account that has never had one.
 *   3. The phrase is typed in capitals and checked on the server.
 *   4. A request row is written with a thirty day clock on it.
 *   5. Every session is ended and the account is BANNED for the window, which
 *      is what deactivated means here: it is enforced by the auth server and
 *      not by a flag the app has to remember to check.
 *   6. An email goes out carrying the date and the restore code, because a
 *      banned account cannot be signed into and the code is the way back.
 *   7. Every one of those steps is written to `audit_log`.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DESTROYED TODAY. The purge runs at the end of the window, on the
 * cron harness, in `lib/cron/jobs/account-purge.ts`.
