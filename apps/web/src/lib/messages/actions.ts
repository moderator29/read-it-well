/**
 * The messaging loop: start a conversation, send, attach, confirm inspection,
 * mark read.
 *
 * Every write runs under the sender's own RLS-bound client, so the database is
 * the authority on membership: a message into a conversation the caller does
 * not belong to is refused by policy, not by application code. The database
 * triggers own the fan-out: a message insert bumps the conversation's
 * last_message_at and writes the other participant's notification row, so no
 * code path here can forget either. Marking a thread read is the one place the
 * service role appears, because participants deliberately hold no UPDATE
 * policy on messages; membership is proven through an RLS read first.
 *
 * One durable throttle lives here: how many brand new conversations a guest may
 * open in a day, so mass first-message scraping of agents' contacts is not free.
 * Sending inside an existing thread is never throttled.
