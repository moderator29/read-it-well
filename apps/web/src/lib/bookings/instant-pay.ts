 * The database decides, never this file. With `stays_instant_pay` on, the
 * trigger `bookings_instant_when_fixed_price` (migration
 * d73a_stays_instant_pay) accepts the guest's own booking when it is written
 * and records the stay agreement as approved by the system (decided_by null,
 * terms.instant_booking true). The app only reads what happened, so the guest
 * goes straight to paying when the database said yes and keeps today's
 * request screen when it did not (switch off, a host with no payout set up, an
 * agent without a live mandate).
