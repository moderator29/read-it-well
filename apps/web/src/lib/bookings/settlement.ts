/**
 * Booking settlement: the one place a card charge becomes a paid booking.
 *
 * Shared deliberately. The Paystack webhook and the return-from-Paystack
 * verify path both call `settleBookingCharge`, so whichever arrives first does
 * the work and the second is a no-op. Nothing here is duplicated between the
 * two callers, because two implementations of settlement is two chances to
 * disagree about money.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT IDEMPOTENT, AND SAFE AGAINST A SECOND PAYMENT. The decision is
 * the database's, in `private.settle_booking_charge`, under the booking's lock:
 * an attempt already SUCCESSFUL or REFUNDED moves nothing; the first charge
 * that matches an approved agreement settles it and writes one ledger row and
 * one Guarantee contribution; any other charge the processor has taken (no
 * approved agreement, the booking is already paid, cancelled or finished, or
 * the amount is not its price) is marked refund-due and goes back to the CARD.
 * Vallo never keeps it and never credits it anywhere: there is no wallet
 * (Track A, 25 September 2026).
 *
 * A stay can be CONFIRMED and still unpaid, because a host accepting a
 * request-to-book stay confirms it without any money arriving. So "did the
 * status change" is not the same question as "did money move on this call",
 * and a receipt must be gated on `outcome: "settled"`, never on `confirmed`.
 *
 * THE SPLIT. The charge was opened with a Paystack split that the database
 * computed (`public.payment_split_for_booking`): the lister's share to their
 * subaccount, the Guarantee contribution to the reserve subaccount, and
 * Vallo's commission (zero today) to the main account. The ledger row records
 * exactly that: gross = platform fee + lister share + processor fee +
 * guarantee, in integer kobo, with the processor's fee borne by the lister's
 * subaccount as the split's bearer.
