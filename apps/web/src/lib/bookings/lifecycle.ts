/**
 * The booking lifecycle, as decisions.
 *
 * Three moves end a booking's life without a guest or a host tapping
 * anything, and one move is a host's call that the platform must never
 * make for them:
 *
 *   - a PENDING request nobody confirmed within the hold window is released
 *     (CANCELLED, the calendar returned, the guest told);
 *   - a paid CONFIRMED stay whose check-out day has passed is COMPLETED;
 *   - inventory that disagrees with the bookings behind it is reported, never
 *     corrected;
 *   - NO_SHOW is recorded by the host (or an admin) and only from arrival day.
 *
 * The database does the moving, in the B4 functions
 * (supabase/migrations/*_b4_booking_lifecycle_sweeps.sql), because each move
 * touches two or three tables and must happen whole. This module is the same
 * rules written where a test can reach them: which rows qualify, what they
 * move to, what the sweep should say about what it found. The cron jobs
 * under lib/cron/jobs use the parsers and verdicts here; the no-show action
 * uses the decision here to answer a host in plain words before the database
 * is asked at all. scripts/probes/b4_lifecycle.sh runs the same cases against
 * the SQL, so the two halves are held to one set of answers.
 *
 * No server-only import, on purpose: everything here is pure and the zod
 * schema is shared with the control that submits it.

 * IS FAILING. Those are different questions and only the second is worth
 * waking somebody for.
 *
 * What it cost, measured on this project on 22 September.
 * `vallo_reconcile_payments` run 8187 failed at 15:47 on a pasted newline in
 * the site URL. That was fixed at 17:37 and the job has returned 200 on its
 * own schedule since. At 18:20 this function raised the 15:47 failure as a
 * fresh critical alert, and with a 25 hour window it would have gone on doing
 * so, hourly, until the following afternoon: TWENTY-TWO CRITICAL ALERTS ABOUT
 * ONE FIXED FAULT. That is how a desk gets switched off, and this platform has
 * already paid once for a desk nobody opened.
 *
 * So each failure now carries `recoveredAt`, the next success of the same job,
 * and only the STANDING ones raise. The recovered ones are never discarded:
 * they stay in the counts and in the envelope on every run, so a job flapping
 * between failing and recovering reads as exactly that rather than as silence.
 *
 * `available: false` still raises nothing, and an unknown recovery still
 * counts as standing. See the note on the schema field.
