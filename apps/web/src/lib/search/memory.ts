/**
 * What the browser remembers between hunts.
 *
 * Three small memories, one module, because they are the same mechanism and
 * splitting them across three files is how two of them end up with different
 * pruning rules and a third with none:
 *
 *   the chosen view    list or map, in a COOKIE
 *   recent searches    the last few real hunts, in local storage
 *   recently viewed    the last few places opened, in local storage
 *
 * WHY THE VIEW IS A COOKIE AND THE OTHER TWO ARE NOT. The view has to be known
 * BEFORE the first byte of HTML: `/search` is rendered on the server, and a
 * map-preferring person arriving with no `view=` in the address must get the
 * map in that render, not a list that flips to a map a beat later. Only a
 * cookie is readable at that point. The other two are decoration on an already
 * correct page, so they can arrive after hydration, and keeping them out of
 * every request header is worth the flicker-free-ness they do not need.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS TRUSTED ON THE WAY BACK IN. Everything is read back through
 * a validator: local storage is user-writable, survives a deploy, and will
 * contain whatever shape this file wrote three versions ago. A bad entry is
 * dropped, never rendered and never thrown.

/**
 * What the recent strip subscribes to, so it stops guessing at mount.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT IN THE COMPONENT.
 *
 * `RecentStrip` read both lists in a mount effect and pushed them into state.
 * That is `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, and more to the point it meant the
 * strip could only ever show what was in storage at the moment it mounted. On
 * `/search` the strip and the search form are on the same screen: a search run
 * from that form calls `rememberSearch`, and the strip above it went on showing
 * the list from before, with no way to be told.
 *
 * A store needs the writes to notify, and the writes are here. That is the whole
 * reason this lives beside `writeList` rather than in a component module: a
 * subscription whose publisher does not know about it is a subscription that
 * only works across tabs, which is the half-working control this codebase keeps
 * finding and taking out.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SNAPSHOTS ARE CACHED ON THE RAW STRING, WHICH IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` compares snapshots by identity, so a reader that parses
 * JSON into a fresh array on every call re-renders for ever. Each list caches
 * its parsed value against the raw text it was parsed from, and rebuilds only
 * when that text moves.
