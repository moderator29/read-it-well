/**
 * Handing a business to somebody, as an offer rather than as an act.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS "use server", SO IT EXPORTS ASYNC FUNCTIONS AND NOTHING ELSE.
 * Every type and constant the screens need lives in `schema.ts` or
 * `queries.ts`. Section 10.7 of the ledger records what the other mistake
 * costs: twenty minutes of production, in this build. Types DECLARED inside
 * this module are erased whole and stay legal; an export STATEMENT for one is
 * what the actions manifest cannot answer for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. `public.businesses.owner_id` cascades onto `auth.users`,
 * and the account purge deliberately does not delete that row, so before this
 * existed a hotel could keep selling rooms with a tombstone behind it. Owning
 * a business a stranger can still transact against is now a deletion
 * precondition, and a precondition with no route out is a dead end wearing an
 * explanation. This is the first of the two routes out. The second is closing
 * the business, which is unpublishing the rooms, settling the diary and taking
 * it off the market, and which uses the surfaces that already exist.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS AN ACCEPT STEP. Ownership here carries the published inventory
 * a stranger books, the reservations a guest turns up for and the papers a
 * reviewer reads. Moving that onto somebody without asking would make a person
 * a merchant while they slept and would hand anybody a way to dump a failing
 * business onto an account that never asked for it. So an offer is PENDING
 * until it is accepted, and the acceptance is the consent record.
 *
 * THE SERVICE ROLE RESOLVES THE ADDRESS, AND THAT IS THE POINT. There is no
 * "does this email have an account" function reachable over PostgREST, because
 * one would be an enumeration oracle for every signed-in caller. The lookup
 * happens here, behind a session, behind a rate limit, and only after this
 * action has proved through the caller's OWN client that they own the business
 * they are trying to give away.
 *
 * AND IT STILL SAYS WHEN THERE IS NO ACCOUNT. A silent "we have sent it" for
 * an address nobody holds would leave the owner waiting for an answer that can
 * never come, which is the dead end the precondition exists to prevent. A
 * person acting on their own business, about an address they typed, is told
 * the truth: there is no Vallo account on it yet.
 *
 * THE ADDRESS IS NEVER STORED AND NEVER LOGGED. It lives inside one call.

/**
 * CLOSE IT: the second door, and it had no surface at all until this.
 *
 * WHAT WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The brief said the closing paths
 * mostly exist already and asked for them to be checked rather than named.
 * Three of the four do. `lib/agent/listings-actions.ts` carries
 * `unpublishListing`, which is a real control on `/agent/listings`;
 * `lib/reservations/actions.ts` carries `respondToReservation` and
 * `cancelReservation`, which `/agent/bookings` draws; the wallet settles on
 * `/wallet`. THE FOURTH DID NOT EXIST. Nothing in `lib/host/**` could take an
 * accommodation or a business off the market: `publishAccommodation` is in
 * `lib/admin/business-actions.ts` and is admin only, so a host asked to
 * unpublish their rooms had nowhere to go and the second door was a dead end.
 * This is that control.
 *
 * WHAT CLOSING MEANS, AND IT IS `DRAFT` RATHER THAN `SUSPENDED`. SUSPENDED is
 * what the platform does TO somebody; DRAFT is what a person does to their own
 * work, and it is exactly what `unpublishListing` already writes for a
 * property listing. The rows all stay. Nothing is deleted and nothing is
 * destroyed: the business stops being findable and its rooms stop being
 * bookable, and everything on it is still there if they come back.
 *
 * THE DIARY IS SETTLED FIRST, AND THE REFUSAL SAYS WHERE. Unpublishing a
 * restaurant that is holding tables tonight would leave those guests with a
 * booking against something nobody can find, and
 * `private.reservation_is_valid` would then refuse every write to those rows
 * including the cancellation, so they could never be settled at all. So a
 * business with a table still to come is refused here and sent to
 * `/agent/bookings`, which is where the control to settle it actually lives.
 *
 * EVERYTHING GOES THROUGH THE CALLER'S OWN CLIENT. `businesses_owner_all` and
 * `accommodations_owner_all` are the only permission this needs, so no service
 * key is used and this can never close somebody else's business.
