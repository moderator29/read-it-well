/**
 * THE LISTER'S ARITHMETIC (D51, the agreement gate; corrected by D61), as pure
 * integer maths.
 *
 *   Rent you set                          1,800,000
 *   Platform fee                     36,000 to 72,000
 *     Vallo, 2%                           36,000
 *     Escrow protection, 2%
 *     when a buyer pays into escrow       36,000
 *   You receive                   1,728,000 to 1,764,000
 *
 * WHY A RANGE (D61). The rail is chosen per booking, by how the buyer pays,
 * long after the lister accepts. On the escrow rail the lister bears Vallo's
 * commission and the escrow partner's fee; on the direct rail, Vallo's
 * commission and the payment processor's fee, which the processor caps. So no
 * single percentage is true at acceptance, and the screen shows the worst case
 * as the figure to count on, with the better rail as the top of the range.
 *
 * WHAT THE CODE ASSUMES ABOUT THE DIRECT RAIL. `lib/payments/paystack.ts`
 * builds the split with `bearer_type: "subaccount"` and `bearer_subaccount`
 * set to the lister's subaccount, so the lister bears the processor's fee on
 * the direct rail (VALLO_PRICING.md section 7 says the same). The top of the
 * range is therefore NOT rent minus Vallo's 2 percent: it is that minus the
 * processor's fee at its cap (`directProcessorFeeCapMinor`), which is the
 * least the lister can receive on that rail. With a cap of zero it is exactly
 * D61's 1,764,000; with Paystack's 2,000 naira cap it is 1,762,000. Every
 * figure shown is one the lister receives at least, so a booking can only
 * land above it.
 *
 * Every rate is POLICY DATA, read on the server and handed in
 * (`ListerFeePolicy`), never a constant here: changing a price is a row, not
 * a deploy. Each fee is the split's own rounding, `floor(amount * bps /
 * 10000)` in integer kobo, exactly as `payment_split_for_booking` computes the
 * commission leg. BigInt, so a land price in the billions of kobo cannot lose
 * a digit.
 *
 * Client-safe and pure.
