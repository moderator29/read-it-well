/**
 * THE READS THE PROTECTED RAIL'S SURFACES NEED, AND THAT DO NOT EXIST YET.
 *
 * Each one is Session 2's, through the D50 adapter that turns a partner's
 * answer into Vallo's vocabulary (`lib/money/vallo.ts`). Until it lands, and
 * until the protected rail is live (`lib/money/rails.ts`, D50 condition 3),
 * every read answers `absent` without calling anything, and every surface
 * draws its honest absent state. Nothing here ever fabricates a figure: there
 * is no fixture path in this file, and the dev previews pass their fixtures
 * to the components directly, labelled as fixtures.
 *
 * The request each read waits on is named in the C2 report:
 *   readMyBalances          C2 REQUEST 3 (R-3: GET wallet, main and escrow balance)
 *   prepareWithdrawalQuote  C2 REQUEST 4 (R-4/R-5: create the intent, read the fee back)
 *   readMyProtectedPayments C2 REQUEST 9 (R-6 and the section 8 status normalisation)

 * before any protected payment does. Absent unless that read has the
