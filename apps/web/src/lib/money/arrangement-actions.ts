 * STEP 10 to 11: the renter releases a protected payment to the lister.
 * A deliberate act (the money swipe), the renter only, through the service in
 * provider-arrangements.ts, which refuses unless the escrow flows are built,
 * `rentals_protected_pay` is on, the payment is held and the release is not
 * paused by Vallo (the database refuses a paused release as well). Nothing is
 * marked released here: Payluk's webhook does that.
