/**
 * THE SHAPE OF A MONEY HISTORY, AND EVERY DECISION ABOUT HOW IT READS.
 *
 * Three screens draw the same record from three sides: what a renter or guest
 * paid (`my_payments_history`), what a lister was paid by Paystack's split
 * (`my_earnings_history`), and the platform-wide view on the Money desk
 * (`admin_money_history`). The database functions return rows of money that
 * has ALREADY MOVED. Nothing here adds them into a figure Vallo is keeping for
 * anybody, because Vallo keeps nothing: the lister's share settled to their
 * bank in the same transaction the payer paid (docs/MONEY_ARCHITECTURE.md).
 *
 * This file is pure, client-safe and tested, so the three pages cannot
 * disagree about the three things a reader actually checks:
 *
 *   1. WHICH WAY THE MONEY WENT. On the payer's side a payment is money out
 *      and a refund is money back. On the lister's side an earning is money in
 *      and a reversal is money out. The sign is decided by the KIND, never by
 *      the sign of the figure, because a reversal arrives negative and a
 *      refund arrives positive and both mean "less for this reader".
 *   2. WHAT STATE IT IS IN, as a word. A refund still with the processor is
 *      "Processing", never drawn as settled money.
 *   3. WHICH DAY IT HAPPENED, in Lagos time, whatever the viewer's clock says.
 *
 * All money is integer kobo from start to finish. Nothing here divides it.

 * and runs in the unit suite; if that map ever moves a word, move it here too.
