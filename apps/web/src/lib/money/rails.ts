/**
 * WHICH RAIL A MEMBER CAN ACTUALLY USE NOW.
 *
 * The DIRECT rail (the processor splits each charge in the same transaction;
 * nobody holds anything) is always live. The PROTECTED rail (a licensed
 * partner holds the payment until the payer confirms) is live only when it
 * can genuinely work, which is a fact the SERVER reads at request time, never
 * a constant: the partner's key is configured for this deployment (the live
 * key in production only, the test key elsewhere), the outage stop
 * `PAYMENTS_KILL_PAYLUK` is not set, and the founder's switch
 * `payments_payluk_on` is on (`protectedRailLive()` in `rail-live.ts`, which
 * asks `escrowRailLive()`; the database checks the same switch again).
 *
 * This file stays pure so client components can import the type: the answer
 * is passed in by the server page that read it.
 *
 * While the protected rail is not live: no Protected figure and no escrow
 * option is drawn, and every live surface speaks the direct rail's sentences.
 * The dev previews draw the protected surfaces with fixture data, labelled as
 * fixtures.
