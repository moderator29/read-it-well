/**
 * VALLO ERROR LANGUAGE (D50). A provider's code and message stay in the
 * server log and the audit view; a member sees a Vallo error code and a
 * sentence that claims nothing about money it cannot know.
 *
 * Built from the documented codes only: Payluk `essentials_errors` (400, 401,
 * 403, 404, 410, 429, 500, 503) and plain HTTP for Paystack. The sentences
 * are operational, and deliberately never say "nothing was charged": after
 * a timeout that is not known (a timeout is unknown, not a failure).
