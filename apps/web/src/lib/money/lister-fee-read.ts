/**
 * THE RATES IN FORCE FOR ONE LISTING, READ ON THE SERVER (D51, D61).
 *
 * The lister's fees are policy data, in basis points and kobo, with a version
 * recorded against every acceptance. That read does not exist yet: it is C2
 * REQUEST 1 to Session 2, revised by D61, `public.lister_fee_policy(p_listing,
 * p_property_type, p_listing_intent)` returning one row of `rate_version`,
 * `commission_bps` (Vallo, both rails), `escrow_protection_bps` (the escrow
 * partner's fee the lister bears), `direct_processor_fee_cap_minor` (the most
 * the processor's fee can be on a direct payment, borne by the lister as the
 * split's bearer; 0 if not) and `cap_minor` (a cap on Vallo's commission, or
 * null). No `rail`: the rail is not knowable when the lister accepts.
 *
 * Until it lands the call fails and this answers null, and the fee gate says
 * it cannot show the figures. It never falls back to a typed rate: a guessed
 * 400 is exactly the hardcoded number D51 forbids.
