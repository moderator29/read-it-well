/**
 * THE VALLO STATUS VOCABULARY (D50; VALLO_FINANCIAL_LAYER.md section 4 item 1).
 *
 * Eleven statuses a member may see, and the tables that map every provider
 * word onto them. The rule: a raw provider status never reaches a member.
 * Provider words stay in `providerStatus` columns and in the audit view.
 *
 * Two rules from D50 are built into the tables, not left to callers:
 *  - Never "paid" before the provider has confirmed it. Anything not a
 *    confirmed success is at most `processing`.
 *  - An unknown provider word is `under_review`, never a guess at success
 *    or failure (a timeout is unknown, not a failure).
 *
 * This is a business vocabulary, separate from the escrow state machine
 * (7.6), whose `provider_status` column is likewise never overwritten.
 * The member-facing LABELS below are drafts for founder review (7.14); the
 * keys are the contract.
