/**
 * THE CALM WAY OUT OF THE ESCROW STEP (founder instruction, 13 October 2026:
 * if opening or funding escrow fails, the payer gets a calm message and can
 * switch to card where the rules allow; nobody is stranded; nothing is marked
 * paid without the partner's confirmation).
 *
 *   1. Card must be allowed on this deal (`payment_rail_options`, read as the
 *      payer): a purchase is escrow only, so it is refused with a sentence.
 *   2. An escrow opened at the partner and never funded is withdrawn THERE
 *      first (`withdrawForCard`), so it can never be funded for a deal that
 *      is now on card. Anything the partner may be moving, or holds, is never
 *      withdrawn: the payer is told where their money is instead.
 *   3. The payer's choice moves to card (`payment_rail_choose`, the database
 *      decides who and when) and the card checkout opens. If the gate asks a
 *      person to look first, the payer is told so on the agreement, where
 *      they can go back to escrow.
 * Nothing here charges anything.
