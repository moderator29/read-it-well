/**
 * THE LISTER'S CHARGEBACK HOLD, as their money screens read it.
 *
 * The payout rule is `public.lister_chargeback_hold(lister)`: true while the
 * lister has a LOST chargeback whose recovery is still owed. An undecided
 * chargeback holds nothing (one dispute must not stop a lister's business
 * before it is decided), so it is shown as its own calmer state.
 *
 * Two sources, one shape:
 *   - the draft `public.my_chargeback_hold()` (cb01), the signed-in person's
 *     own answer with the owed total, the count and the undecided count;
 *   - until that lands, the live `lister_chargeback_hold(uuid)` for the
 *     session's own id, which says held or not and nothing more.
 *
 * Pure: the read is `chargeback-hold.ts`.
