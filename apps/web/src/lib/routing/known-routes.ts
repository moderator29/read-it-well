/**
 * OPS-17: THE FIRST PATH SEGMENTS THIS APP ANSWERS AT.
 *
 * A signed-out request for a closed page is sent to sign-in, and so was a
 * request for an address that does not exist at all: every mistyped or dead
 * link became a 307 to a sign-in screen, and no signed-out 404 ever existed.
 * The proxy now answers an unknown first segment with the site's real 404
 * instead. `known-routes.test.ts` walks `src/app` and fails when a routable
 * directory is added or removed without this list following it. The
 * extra names are `next.config.ts` redirects (`/agents…` and `/trips`,
 * folded into Plans by V-76, and `/escrow`, retired by Track A
 * on 25 September 2026 and sent to `/agreements`). `/wallet` was one too, until
 * the member balance (Part B phase 6) became its page. `/support` was one until
 * it became a page of its own, the in-app help and support home.
