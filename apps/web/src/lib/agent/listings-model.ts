/**
 * Agent listing input schemas and the canonical submit gate.
 *
 * Two audiences share this file, which is the whole point. The wizard imports
 * it in the browser to light up its checklist as the agent works, and the
 * server actions import it to decide what may actually enter the review queue.
 * One definition of "ready", so the checklist can never promise something the
 * server then refuses.
 *
 * Drafts are forgiving on purpose: a half-typed listing must always be
 * saveable, because a lost draft is a lost listing and a lost listing is lost
 * supply. Only the title is asked for to save. Everything else is asked for at
 * submit, where the quality gate lives (HYBRID_INVENTORY section 5).
 *
 * Money crosses the boundary exactly once, here: naira text in,
 * Math.round(naira * 100) integer kobo out. Nothing downstream ever sees a
 * float.
 *
 * THREE MARKETS, THREE MONEY SHAPES, and the wizard has to ask for exactly one
 * of them. `intent` is the first question and everything after it follows:
 *
 *   SALE      an asking price, the title being sold, and a sale status.
 *   TENANCY   a rent and its cycle, plus the fee breakdown a Nigerian tenant
 *             is actually quoted: caution, service charge, agency, legal,
 *             agreement, and the total to find at the door.
 *   SHORT STAY a rate per night, or per head for a restaurant table.
 *
 * Which of the two rent shapes applies is decided by the property type through
 * `isTenancy`, not by another question: a shop is let by the year and a
 * shortlet is let by the night, and asking somebody to confirm that is asking
 * them to restate what they already told us.

   The upload ceilings, stated once and enforced in three places.

   THE BROWSER IS NOT A LIMIT. Anything checked only in JavaScript is a courtesy

   each of these numbers appears three times on purpose, and the three are not
   redundant, they are three different kinds of protection:

     1. HERE, so the uploader can refuse a file before spending somebody's
        Nigerian mobile data pushing fifty megabytes that will bounce.
     2. On the STORAGE BUCKET, in Postgres, as file_size_limit and
        allowed_mime_types. This is the one that actually holds: it is enforced
        by the storage service against the upload itself, whatever the client
        believes.
     3. In the SERVER ACTION that attaches the object to a listing, which reads
        the object's real size and type back from storage rather than trusting
        what it was told.

   Fifty megabytes for a video is the owner's number. It is roughly a minute of

 * fixed. `APPROVED` says "Approved", which is true and reads as finished. It
 * is not finished: approve and publish are two separate acts and the second is
 * OURS, so a lister sees a success-coloured "Approved" chip on a property that
 * is not in search, with nothing saying a step is pending on our side. The
 * notification that made it worse by telling them to publish it themselves is
 * fixed (`lib/admin/actions.ts`), and so is the email. The CHIP is not, for
 * two reasons that are both about not making things worse: the live string
 * lives in a shared dictionary namespace, and the colour
 * comes from `toneForStatus`, which maps APPROVED to success for bookings,
 * payments, support tickets and six other families at once. Both belong to
