/**
 * Agent application submission.
 *
 * Validation is real and runs on the server. When Supabase is configured and the
 * applicant is signed in, the application is persisted to agent_applications
 * under Row Level Security as a SUBMITTED row, and the generated VL-AGT-#####
 * reference is returned. When Supabase is not configured, or the user is not
 * signed in, this returns a plain, honest message rather than a fake approval
 * (Master Rule 8). The client keeps the draft in local storage either way, so
 * nothing the applicant typed is lost (Master Rule 57, never lose a draft).
 *
 * DOCUMENTS. The wizard uploads each file straight from the browser into the
 * private agent-documents bucket under `<auth uid>/<batch>/...`, which storage
 * RLS restricts to that user's own folder, and then hands this action the paths.
 * Nothing here trusts those strings: every one must live under the caller's own
 * uid prefix or the whole submission is refused, so a crafted path cannot claim
 * somebody else's object. The rows are written through the applicant's own
 * client, under the same RLS that guards reading them.
 *
 * Documents are REQUIRED, and that is the point of the feature. An application
 * with no identity document cannot be verified by anybody, so accepting one
 * would mean filling the admin queue with items no reviewer can action. Before
 * this, the files never left the browser at all and every application arrived
 * showing zero documents.
