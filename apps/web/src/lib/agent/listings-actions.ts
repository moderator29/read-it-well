/**
 * The supply loop: an agent's listings, from first typed word to review queue.
 *
 * Every export here is a public endpoint, so every one of them starts the same
 * way: resolve the session, respect the "agent_listings" flag, then resolve the
 * caller's row in public.agents. That last step is the load-bearing one.
 * listings.agent_id references public.agents(id), never the auth user id, so an
 * action that skipped it would either write nothing or write the wrong owner.
 * Whoever has no agents row gets one honest sentence and a way forward.
 *
 * Writes go through the caller's own RLS-bound client, so Postgres is the
 * authority on ownership and this file never re-implements a policy. The
 * service role is not used anywhere in this feature: an agent managing their
 * own supply needs no privilege escalation.
 *
 * submitListing runs the canonical gate from listings-schema against the STORED
 * row, its photos and its amenities. The wizard runs the same function on the
 * client to draw its checklist. The client copy is a courtesy; this one is the
 * rule, and it is the half of the photo quality gate that cannot be skipped by
 * anyone posting straight at the endpoint.
