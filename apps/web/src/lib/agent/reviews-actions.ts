/**
 * The host's answer to a review.
 *
 * A review is final: public.reviews carries no update policy, deliberately, so
 * nobody can edit what a guest wrote. An answer is a different object living
 * in public.review_responses, one per review, owned by the agent whose listing
 * was reviewed.
 *
 * Nothing here restates the database's rules. Ownership is a policy
 * (review_responses_insert_own), authorship is a BEFORE trigger that stamps
 * agent_id from the caller, the length bound is a check constraint, and the
 * guest's notification is an AFTER trigger. This file validates the shape of
 * the input, writes through the agent's own RLS-bound client, and turns a
 * refusal into a sentence a person can act on.
 *
 * The service role is never used here. An answer written as the service role
 * would bypass the ownership check that is the entire point of the policy.
