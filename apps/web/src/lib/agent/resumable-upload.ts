/**
 * A resumable upload, because fifty megabytes on a Nigerian mobile connection
 * will not survive a single POST.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR, WITH THE ARITHMETIC.
 *
 * A walkthrough is capped at 50MB. On a typical Nigerian mobile uplink of
 * roughly one megabit that is about seven minutes of uninterrupted upload. Seven
 * minutes is longer than a lift, longer than a handover between masts, and
 * longer than most people will hold a phone still. `supabase.storage.upload` is
 * ONE request with no chunking, no resume and no retry: the connection drops at
 * minute six and the whole thing starts again, if the person has not already
 * given up. That is not a rare case on this market, it is the ordinary one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS IS.
 *
 * The TUS 1.0.0 resumable protocol, spoken directly to Supabase Storage's
 * `/storage/v1/upload/resumable` endpoint with `fetch`. Three verbs:
 *
 *   POST   creates the upload and answers with a URL that names it.
 *   PATCH  sends one chunk at a byte offset and answers with the new offset.
 *   HEAD   asks the server how much it actually holds, which is how a resume
 *          after a dropped connection knows where to start.
 *
 * WHY NOT `tus-js-client`. It is the obvious answer and it is a dependency
 * added to a tree eight people are working in, for about a hundred and fifty
 * lines we need exact control over: the chunk size Supabase demands, the
 * progress the UI reports, and where the resume token is kept. The protocol is
 * small and stable and this is all of it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT OPTIONAL AND ARE EASY TO GET WRONG.
 *
 * 1. THE CHUNK IS EXACTLY 6MB, EVERY TIME BUT THE LAST. Supabase's storage
 *    layer requires it and answers 400 otherwise. It is not a tuning knob.
 *
 * 2. THE UPLOAD URL IS KEPT, AND KEPT ON THE DEVICE. A resume within one page
 *    life is easy. The case worth building for is the phone that lost signal,
 *    locked, and came back ten minutes later: the tab has been reloaded and
 *    everything in memory is gone. So the URL is written to `localStorage`
 *    against a key made from the listing, the file name, its size and its last
 *    modified time, which together identify one file well enough that resuming
 *    the wrong one is not a thing that can happen.
 *
 * 3. EVERY READ AND WRITE OF THAT STORE IS WRAPPED. Private browsing, a
 *    cleared site and a blocked cookie jar all throw on access rather than
 *    returning null, and an upload that cannot start because storage is
 *    disabled would be a bizarre failure to explain to somebody.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ONE THING THAT WOULD BREAK THIS SILENTLY, NAMED SO IT IS LOOKED AT
 * FIRST RATHER THAN LAST.
 *
 * The whole protocol depends on the browser being ALLOWED TO READ two
 * response headers across an origin: `Location` on the create, and
 * `Upload-Offset` on every chunk. A cross-origin response hides every header
 * that is not in its `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`, and a hidden header
 * reads as `null` rather than as an error. Supabase Storage exposes both,
 * which is how every TUS client works against it, and if this ever starts
 * reporting "the upload could not be started" on a request that returned 201,
 * that is the first thing to check and not the last. The CSP is not the
 * suspect: `connect-src` already names the Supabase origin (`lib/security/csp.ts`).
