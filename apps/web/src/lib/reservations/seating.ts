/**
 * RESTAURANTS EARN ON COMPLETED DEALS ONLY (founder decision D).
 *
 * Booking a table is free for the diner. Vallo earns a flat fee per seated
 * guest, billed to the restaurant at the end of the month. A table is seated
 * when the restaurant types the diner's check-in code, taps Seated, a bill is
 * paid through Vallo, or the diner says yes when asked a day later and the
 * restaurant never answered. A disagreement goes to Vallo.
 *
 * Pure: the words, the rules a screen needs before it asks the database, and
 * the reading of the rows (`reservation_seatings`, `restaurant_bills`) the
 * pending migration 20261013100000 adds. The database decides; this only
 * says it in words and keeps buttons from being offered when they would be
 * refused.
