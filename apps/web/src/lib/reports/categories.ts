/**
 * What a person can report, and what they can call it.
 *
 * Client-safe AND zod-free: imports nothing at all, so the report sheet can
 * render the same categories the action validates against (`schema.ts` builds
 * its enums from these very arrays and re-exports them), and neither can
 * drift. The validator used to live in this same module, which put the whole
 * of zod, about 62 KB gzipped, into the first load of every page carrying a
 * "Report this" link: the listing, the stay, the restaurant, the thread. The
 * same split as `lib/interests/property-types.ts` from its `schema.ts`.
 *
 * The list is deliberately short and deliberately concrete. A reporting form
 * with fifteen overlapping options gets "other" every time, and "other" is
 * exactly the free-text soup that made the reports queue unsortable in the
 * first place. Every code here is also a check constraint value on
 * public.reports, so an invented one is refused by the database as well.
