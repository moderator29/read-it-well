/**
 * THE PRODUCT'S HIERARCHY, WRITTEN DOWN.
 *
 * HISTORY IS NOT HIERARCHY. Every back control on this platform used to call
 * `router.back()`, which walks the BROWSER'S history: the list of places the
 * machinery happened to send somebody, in the order it sent them. A person who
 * arrived at `/settings/account` through a sign-in bounce has `/sign-in` behind
 * them. A person who followed a deep link from a notification has whatever they
 * were reading in another application behind them, or nothing. A redirect leaves
 * the redirector behind them. In none of those cases is the previous entry the
 * parent of the current screen, and in all of them the old control cheerfully
 * went there. That is how a person inside the Console pressed back and landed on
 * the login page, and how somebody inside a feature pressed back and landed on
 * the marketing site.
 *
 * `canGoBackInApp()` in `lib/ui/history.ts` was the previous guard and it is not
 * wrong, it is answering a different question. It proves there is a screen of
 * OURS behind this one. It cannot prove that screen is the PARENT of this one,
 * because two of its three answers (our own sequence stamp, and a same-origin
 * referrer) carry no URL at all, and the third (`navigation.canGoBack`) is a
 * boolean. A control that trusts it is trusting "somewhere in our app" to mean
 * "one level up", and those are not the same claim.
 *
 * So the hierarchy is DECLARED, here, once, and read by
 * `lib/nav/resolve.ts`. This file is meant to be read by a person checking
 * whether the product's shape is what they think it is. It holds no logic on
 * purpose.
 *
 * HOW TO READ AN ENTRY.
 *
 *   "/listing/[id]": "/search",
 *
 * Left: a route pattern, spelled exactly as the directory under `src/app` is
 * spelled, minus the route groups (`(app)`, `(auth)`, `(site)`) which never
 * appear in a URL. `[id]` matches one segment.
 *
 * Right: that route's parent, as a pattern. Dynamic segments in the parent are
 * filled from the ones captured on the left, which is what makes
 * `"/u/[handle]/followers": "/u/[handle]"` resolve `/u/ada/followers` to
 * `/u/ada` rather than to a literal `[handle]`.
 *
 * `ROOT` means this route is the top of the hierarchy. There is nothing above
 * it, no back control belongs on it, and on Android it is the one kind of place
 * where the hardware back button may close the application.
 *
 * A ROUTE THAT IS NOT IN THIS FILE HAS NO DECLARED PARENT, AND THAT IS LOUD
 * RATHER THAN QUIET. `resolve.ts` returns `no-parent-declared`, the control
 * falls through to whatever fallback its caller passed, and a development build
 * prints a warning naming the path. It is deliberately NOT defaulted to "strip
 * the last segment": that guess is right often enough to hide the times it is
 * wrong, and a hierarchy nobody declared is exactly the thing this file exists
 * to stop.
 *
 * WHERE THE PATH DOES NOT MATCH THE HIERARCHY, AND WHY.
 *
 *   /listing/[id] -> /search        A listing's parent is the shelf it was
 *                                   taken off, not `/home`. The old fallback
 *                                   was `/home`, which threw away a filtered
 *                                   hunt every time it fired.
 *   /messages/[id] -> /messages     The inbox, per the founder's own example.
 *   /messages/share/<kind>/[id]     Four entries rather than one, because the
 *                                   thing being shared IS the parent and
 *                                   `kind` is a closed set of literal
 *                                   segments. This reproduces the page's own
 *                                   `back` computation as data.
 *   /rent/move-in/[listingId]       The listing being moved into, not `/rent`.
 *   /around/new -> /around/settings The suggestion flow is entered from the
 *   /around/manage                  feed's settings screen, not from the feed.
 *   /legal/* -> /settings           Reached from Settings, and nowhere else.
 *   /admin/*, /agent/*, /host/*     Each console has its own landing screen,
 *                                   and every screen inside it returns there.
 *                                   Back inside the Console never leaves the
 *                                   Console, which is the founder's first
 *                                   complaint.
 *   /sign-in, /sign-up -> /welcome  NOT `/start`, which is a 307 and not a
 *                                   screen. See the door section below.
 *   /agreements/[id] -> /agreements Track A: the agreement list is where
 *                                   money now lives; the wallet and escrow
 *                                   routes are retired and redirect there.
 *   /price/area/[id] -> /price      What the page itself already passes to
 *                                   `PageHeader`, read off the surface.
 *   /preview/<four decks>/[screen]  Four decks have no index page, so the
 *                                   generic pattern sent back to a 404.
 *
 * EVERY OTHER ROUTE FILE IN `src/app` IS IN `NON_NAVIGABLE` AT THE FOOT OF
 * THIS FILE, with the reason it can never carry a back control, and
 * `route-files.test.ts` fails if any route file is in neither structure. A
 * route nobody has made a decision about is now impossible to add quietly.
 *
 * TWO ENTRIES BELOW DELIBERATELY DRAW NO CONTROL, AND THAT IS NOT THE GAP.
 *
 * A declared parent is a fact about where a screen SITS. It is not a promise
 * that the screen paints an arrow, and these cannot:
 *
 *   /gallery                `notFound()` in a production build by its own
 *                           guard. The control is wired for development, which
 *                           is the only place the board exists.
 *   /offline                the service worker's fallback document, served
 *                           when there is no network at all. Its way up is the
 *                           brand lockup, which links to `/home` - the same
 *                           place a back control would push. A second control
 *                           on a screen that only renders when nothing can be
 *                           fetched would be a control that cannot work.
 *
 * Android is unaffected by both: `isAppRoot` is false for every one of
 * them, so the hardware button goes to the parent rather than closing the
 * shell, which is the half that matters most there.
 *
 * `scripts/design/proof-nav.mjs` walks the rest in a real browser and writes
 * the landed path per route into `docs/design/proofs/nav/`.

 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `ROUTE_PARENTS` above says where a screen sits. It said
 * nothing at all about the rest of `src/app`, and "nothing at all" is
 * indistinguishable from "nobody has looked at it yet", which is how sixty
 * routes drew no back control for months. Every `route.ts` under `src/app` is
 * listed here with the reason it can never carry a back control, so that the
 * set of route files nobody has made a decision about is EMPTY and provably so.
 *
 * `route-files.test.ts` walks `src/app` and fails if a route file is in
 * neither structure, or is in both. A new API handler needs one line here; a
 * new page needs a real decision above. Neither can be added silently.
 *
 * NONE OF THESE CAN EVER BE `window.location.pathname` IN THE SHELL. A route
 * handler answers JSON, JavaScript or a redirect; the web view never settles
 * on one, so `isAppRoot` is never asked about them. They are written down
 * because a thing nobody wrote down is a thing nobody checked.
