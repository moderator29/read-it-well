/**
 * THE MAIN TABS, KEPT READY (13 October 2026, the startup track).
 *
 * The founder: screens show a loading state on navigation when they should
 * appear at once, above all after the app has been away for twenty minutes.
 * The cause, in Next's own code (`client/components/links.js`): a visible
 * `<Link prefetch>` is fetched whole when it enters the viewport and again
 * only when the router's tree changes or a server action invalidates the
 * cache. Nothing fetches it again when the copy simply grows old, and the
 * router refuses a whole prefetch older than `staleTimes.static` (five
 * minutes, `next.config.ts`). So after twenty minutes away every tab tap went
 * to the server and drew its skeleton. Messages lives behind the dock's More
 * button, so it was never visible and never fetched ahead at all, and on a
 * thread or a listing there is no dock to fetch anything.
 *
 * `KeepWarm` (components/app) fetches the main tabs whole when the browser is
 * idle after a page lands, again when the app comes back to the foreground,
 * and again on the first touch after a copy has gone stale. `HoldTabLink`
 * keeps the current screen up for a moment when a tab is tapped whose copy is
 * still on its way, instead of swapping to a skeleton for it.
 *
 * Whether a tab's copy is fresh is read from the browser's own resource
 * timing: the router fetches a route's payload with an `_rsc` query, and the
 * moment that fetch completes is when the copy exists. Nothing here reaches
 * into Next's internal caches.
