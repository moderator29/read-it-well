/**
 * The hierarchy, proved.
 *
 * Every back control on the platform now goes through `chooseBack`, so this
 * file is where the founder's three arrival routes are settled: a redirect, a
 * sign-in bounce and a deep link. In all three the browser's previous entry is
 * NOT the parent, and in all three the old control went there anyway. Each has
 * a test below that fails the moment the parent check is removed.
 *
 * `every declared parent resolves` is the sweep: it walks the whole of
 * `route-parents.ts`, builds a concrete path for each pattern, and insists the
 * parent it names is itself a route in the map. That is what stops an entry
 * pointing at a screen that does not exist, or at a `[handle]` the child never
 * captured, and it is the check a human reads the map against.
