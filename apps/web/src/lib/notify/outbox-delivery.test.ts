/**
 * THE PROOF THAT SOMEBODY RECEIVES SOMETHING.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SEPARATE FROM `outbox.test.ts`.
 *
 * That file proves the queue behaves: claimed once, settled once, never lost,
 * never sent twice. It does it with a `SendPort` handed in, which is the right
 * fake for a question about the queue and the wrong one for a question about
 * delivery, because a recorded call to a function that a test supplied proves
 * only that the test's own function was called.
 *
 * THAT IS EXACTLY HOW NINE BUILDERS STAYED UNREACHABLE UNDER A GREEN SUITE.
 * Every one of them had a test. Every test rendered it. Not one of them ran
 * the path a real event takes, so not one of them could notice that no event
 * ever took it.
 *
 * So this file substitutes NOTHING inside the application. The registry, the
 * builders, the recipient resolution, `sendMessage`, `sendEmail`, the From
 * line, the text alternative and the JSON body are all the production code.
 * The only thing replaced is `globalThis.fetch`, which is the socket itself,
 * and the assertions are on THE HTTP REQUEST THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO RESEND:
 * its URL, its bearer, its recipient, its subject, and both parts of its body.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE SOCKET AND NOT THE REAL ONE.
 *
 * `api.resend.com` is refused by this environment's egress proxy, so no test
 * running here can complete a real POST, and this deployment has no Resend key
 * in any case. Stopping at the socket is therefore the furthest an automated
 * test can honestly go. What it buys is the part that was actually broken: a
 * message that is built, addressed and formatted for the wire, from a row a
 * database trigger wrote, with a real 200 and a real 422 coming back and the
 * row settling differently for each.
