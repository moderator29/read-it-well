/**
 * WHAT NEEDS YOU (recommendation B11, 30 September 2026).
 *
 * `notifications` carries a kind and no severity (`lib/push/preferences.ts`
 * said so), so "your agreement is waiting for your confirmation" and "Tunde
 * liked your post" weighed the same. This is the severity table:
 *
 *   action   something only you can move, with one verb that does it
 *   update   a record you care about changed; nothing is asked of you
 *   fyi      good to know; never wakes the phone
 *
 * THE TABLE IS A DRAFT FOR THE FOUNDER'S SIGN-OFF (docs/recs/RECS_B,
 * "B11 severity table"). These are the defaults meanwhile. The same table is
 * mirrored in SQL (`public.notification_severity`, migration
 * `20260930104610_m1_b11_b13_severity_and_saved_changes`), which stamps new rows; until that
 * is applied, and for any row written before it, the app reads the severity
 * from here. The rules read the kind, the title the database trigger wrote
 * and the in-app destination, in order; the first that matches wins.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no reads.
