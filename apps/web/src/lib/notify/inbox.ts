/**
 * One page of the caller's notifications, newest first, under their own RLS
 * (`notifications_select_own`: a person reads their own rows and nobody
 * else's, admins included).
 *
 * WHY THIS AND NOT `loadNotifications` IN `lib/messages/live.ts`. That loader
 * returns `data ?? []`, so a failed read and an empty inbox were the same
 * value, and the screen told somebody whose read had failed "You are all
 * caught up". This one says which it was. It also pages: the old read stopped
 * at 100 rows with nothing on the screen saying so, and anything older was
 * unreachable.
 *
 * THE CURSOR IS (created_at, id), NOT created_at ALONE. Every row one
 * transaction writes carries the same `now()`, so two notifications for one
 * person from one statement share a timestamp, and a cursor on the timestamp
 * alone would drop whichever of them fell on the far side of a page break.
