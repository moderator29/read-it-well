/**
 * WHAT A ROW IN THE OUTBOX MEANS, AND THE ONLY PLACE THAT DECIDES.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS MODULE IS PURE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT.
 *
 * Nine builders sat unreachable under a passing suite for weeks. The suite was
 * not weak: it rendered every one of them, asserted their subjects, walked
 * their blocks. What it could not do was tell anybody whether a person would
 * ever receive one, because a test that a builder exists and a test that a
 * builder is reached are different tests and only the first one was being
 * written.
 *
 * So the registry below is a VALUE, not a switch statement inside the drain.
 * Every template is an entry in one object, keyed by exactly the string a
 * database trigger writes into `email_outbox.template`. That makes two things
 * checkable that were not checkable before:
 *
 *   EVERY TEMPLATE A TRIGGER CAN WRITE HAS AN ENTRY. The test walks the keys
 *   against the list of templates the migrations enqueue, and a trigger that
 *   writes a template nobody built fails the suite rather than filling the
 *   dead-letter column in production.
 *
 *   EVERY ENTRY RENDERS A REAL MESSAGE FROM A REAL PAYLOAD. The test drives
 *   `build` with the exact payload shape the trigger writes, and asserts on the
 *   subject and the body that come out, not on the existence of a function.
 *
 * There is no Supabase client in this file and there must never be one. The
 * drain does the reading; this decides what the words are.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO PHASES, AND WHY THE READS ARE DECLARED RATHER THAN PERFORMED.
 *
 * Several of these messages need a fact the queue deliberately does not carry:
 * the counterparty's name, the property's title and address, which bank a
 * withdrawal went to. Those are facts about a person, and the outbox holds ids
 * so that a row read out of it describes an event without describing anybody.
 *
 * A template therefore DECLARES what it needs (`needs`) and the drain gathers
 * all of it for the whole batch in a handful of queries, then hands each
 * template a set of lookups. Fifty rows is four reads, not a hundred. A
 * template that asks for a fact the drain could not find gets null from the
 * lookup and says something true without it, which every builder here already
 * supports: "the other person" rather than a name, no property row rather than
 * an empty one.
