/**
 * THE TEST THAT THE OLD SUITE COULD NOT WRITE.
 *
 * Nine builders sat unreachable for weeks under a green suite, because every
 * test asked whether a builder EXISTS and rendered it with a hand-made object.
 * None of them could ask whether anything would ever call it, or whether the
 * thing that called it would hand it the shape a database actually writes.
 *
 * So every case below starts from THE EXACT PAYLOAD A TRIGGER COMPOSES, copied
 * key for key out of the migration that composes it, and asserts on the words
 * that come out the other end. A payload key renamed in SQL without its
 * template being changed fails here, which is the failure the old shape could
 * not see.
