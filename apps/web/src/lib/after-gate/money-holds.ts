/**
 * V-56 AND V-92, TO THE BOUNDARY. The arithmetic of two holds the founder has
 * not yet switched on, pure so it is tested before any money depends on it.
 *
 *   V-56: an on-platform move-in pays the agency fee into a held payment
 *   instead of to the agent, released on keys received or, failing a problem,
 *   14 days after move-in. The rest is paid now. The flag readers are in
 *   `money-holds-flags.ts`; the pay screen draws these lines only when both
 *   `rent_agency_hold` and `held_payments` are on.
 *
 *   V-92: a shortlet caution is a hold on the guest's own wallet, released 48
 *   hours after check-out unless the host claims damage with photos first.
 *
 * Integer kobo; calendar days as YYYY-MM-DD; Lagos wall-clock hours.
