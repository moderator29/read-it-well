/**
 * V-24. Support declines a guest's refund request from the money desk.
 *
 * One call to `decide_refund_request` on the operator's own session: the
 * function checks the admin role, needs a reason the guest will read, records
 * one decision per request (append-only) and tells the guest. A decided
 * request leaves the refund clock and is never alerted on. A refund itself is
 * still made through the existing desk, which already answers the clock.
