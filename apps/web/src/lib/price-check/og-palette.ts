/**
 * THE SHARE IMAGE'S COLOURS, AS LITERALS, AND WHY THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
 * HERE RATHER THAN A RULE BEING DODGED.
 *
 * `nf/no-raw-colour` is an error across `src/lib`, and it is right to be: a
 * literal cannot follow the theme, and dark is the default rather than the
 * only theme. Two things make the Open Graph card the exception, and they are
 * both about the MEDIUM rather than about a migration that has not happened.
 *
 * SATORI RESOLVES NO CSS CUSTOM PROPERTY. `next/og` renders outside the DOM,
 * with no stylesheet and no cascade, so `var(--nf-surface-canvas)` resolves to
 * nothing, and for a colour that means paint nothing. This is the same reason
 * `lib/email/theme.ts` holds literals and is scoped out of the rule by config:
 * Gmail strips `:root` declarations and Outlook's engine never supported them.
 *
 * AND AN OG CARD HAS NO THEME TO FOLLOW. It is rendered once on a server and
 * shown inside somebody else's chat app, which has its own idea of dark and
 * light and will not tell us. One image, dark, stated rather than accidental.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SO THE LITERALS ARE HERE AND NOT IN THE `.tsx`, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
 *
 * `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` aliases `react` at its react-server entry, so
 * nothing that imports a `.tsx` can be loaded by this suite at all. Literals
 * inside `opengraph-image.tsx` would be untestable, and an untested copy of a
 * token is a copy that drifts: `og-palette.test.ts` reads
 * `packages/design-tokens/src/tokens.css` and asserts every value below is
 * still what the token resolves to. That is the shape `lib/email/shell.test.ts`
 * already uses for the email palette, and it is what earns the disables.
 *
 * The rule's own config names the test for a whole-directory exemption and
 * this file does not meet it - it READS colours rather than being the place
 * others read from - so each line takes a disable with its reason, which is
 * what that config says to do instead.
