/**
 * THE FOUR THINGS A PRICE CHECK WRITES, AND WHAT EACH ONE IS ALLOWED TO KEEP.
 *
 * This module exports only async functions, which is what
 * `nf/server-actions-export-only-actions` requires of a "use server" module and
 * what the twenty minute outage of 19 September was about. The schemas and the
 * constants live in `schema.ts` beside it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE COARSENING HAPPENS HERE, NOT ON THE CLIENT, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
 *
 * A client that coarsened its own point could be changed to stop. The server
 * takes the precise point, uses it to ask the gate, and writes only the
 * coarsened form: a five character cell for the funnel, three decimal places
 * for a watch. Neither table has a column a finer one could go in, so this is
 * belt and braces rather than the whole belt.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AND THE FREE TEXT HINT IS NOT A PARAMETER OF ANY FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
 *
 * "Anything else that helps, like the estate name or the nearest landmark" is
 * stored nowhere and parsed never. It lives in the form's own state while the
 * person is on the screen. Section 4.2 of the research file is not a paragraph
 * in a policy; it is a column list, and this is the column that is not in it.

/*
 * THE FREE TEXT ROUTE ONTO A SHARE CARD, AND WHY IT IS CLOSED HERE.
 *
 * `shareAreaSchema.area` is a string a caller supplies, and a server action is
 * a public HTTP endpoint: the screen sends the area the area report was about,
 * but nothing makes a caller use the screen. Until this check, the only thing
 * between an arbitrary 80 character string and the heading on a forwarded card
 * was `price_check_shares_area_is_not_an_address`, which refuses a leading
 * house number and a number followed by a street word and is deliberately
 * narrow so that "1004 Estate" and "Phase 2" get through. "14 Bourdillon" has
 * neither shape and would have been minted.
 *
 * So an area is not a shape question any more. IT MUST BE A NEIGHBOURHOOD NAME
 * WE ACTUALLY HOLD REAL PUBLISHED LISTINGS IN, which is the only neighbourhood
 * vocabulary this platform has and is exactly what a card can honestly be
 * about: a card is minted from the area report, the area report needs three
 * real published listings in that area, and `area_suggestions` is the same
 * set. An area we cannot report on is an area we cannot mint a card for.
 *
 * IT FAILS CLOSED. An unreachable database returns no suggestions and the card
 * is refused. Refusing a card costs a person one tap; minting one that names a
 * building is the thing this whole surface exists to make impossible.
 *
 * A state-wide card carries no area at all and is unaffected.
