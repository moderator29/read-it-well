/**
 * The support agent's tools, and the only facts it is allowed to state.
 *
 * Authorisation model, in one sentence: every personal tool runs on the
 * caller's own Row Level Security client, resolved once per request from their
 * auth cookies, and never on the service role. `resolveSession()` hands back
 * that client already bound to the signed-in user, and each read is filtered
 * by the caller's own id on top of RLS, so a tool physically cannot return
 * another person's booking, wallet, ticket or thread. A signed-out caller has
 * no such client, so the personal tools answer "unavailable, offer sign-in"
 * rather than guessing, and the model is told to say exactly that.
 *
 * Two service-role touches exist in the whole feature and both are named here
 * rather than buried. The anonymous ticket insert inside `fileSupportTicket` is
 * a write of the name and email the person just gave, never a read. And
 * `loadConversationSummaries` resolves the counterpart's DISPLAY NAME through
 * the admin client strictly after RLS has already chosen which conversations
 * exist for this caller, exactly as the inbox does, because profiles and agents
 * are select-own tables and a thread with "Vallo member" on every row answers
 * nobody's question about whether their agent replied.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERY RETURN BELOW: the model never receives a bare
 * number that is money, and never receives a figure the platform was not told.
 * Amounts are formatted here, in kobo-exact naira, and an amount we could not
 * read comes back as an explicit "unknown" the model is instructed to repeat
 * rather than as a zero. A zero beside a currency symbol reads as "free", and
 * this platform has already had one surface tell people that a listing with no
 * price on it cost nothing.
