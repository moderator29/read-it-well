/**
 * Support knowledge base.
 *
 * The answers SupportChat gives instantly, grounded in how Vallo actually
 * works today. Client-safe on purpose: matching runs on the device so common
 * questions cost no network round trip. Anything outside this store is
 * escalated to the human team as a real support ticket.
 *
 * It is also the ONLY policy the support agent may state: `search_help` reads
 * this store and the system prompt forbids answering policy from memory. So an
 * entry here is not a help article, it is the platform's word, and an entry
 * that drifts from what the product does becomes a machine repeating it to
 * every person who asks. Two entries had drifted, both about money, and both
 * are corrected below against the surfaces that own them:
 * `lib/trust/cancellation.ts` for the schedule and `lib/trust/standards.ts`
 * for how fast a person answers.
