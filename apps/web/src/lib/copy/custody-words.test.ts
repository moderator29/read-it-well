/**
 * D48: THE PRODUCT NEVER TELLS A MEMBER THAT VALLO HOLDS THEIR MONEY.
 *
 * On 6 October the experience branch shipped three first runs, "your wallet",
 * "escrow" and "withdrawals", with actions "Open my wallet" and "Open escrow",
 * in the same build as `lib/money/copy.ts` saying "Vallo never holds your
 * money". They were gated only by three keys not being mounted, so one array
 * edit would have published a screen telling a member Vallo was holding their
 * money, which ADR-0002 forbids because it is regulated custody.
 *
 * They were deleted, and this test is what keeps them deleted: it fails if any
 * of those words comes back into a dictionary, a source string, the first-run
 * registry or the sign-in intents. A first run for a provider-held balance
 * (D50) is new copy written against a live rail, not these words restored.
