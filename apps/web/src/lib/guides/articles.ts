/**
 * A14. GUIDES THAT RANK WHILE THE CATALOGUE IS CLOSED.
 *
 * Plain, evergreen answers to what people search before they pay for a home
 * or a stay in Nigeria. THE RULES THEY ARE WRITTEN TO:
 *
 *   No statistic. Nothing here counts scams, prices or people, because the
 *   platform has no such figure it can stand behind.
 *   No law stated as settled beyond what the codebase already cites with a
 *   source (`lib/trust/fee-rules.ts`), and that one is flagged for a lawyer.
 *   Every sentence about Vallo is read from the module that enforces it:
 *   money from `lib/money/copy.ts`, refunds from `lib/trust/cancellation.ts`.
 *   Every guide carries the date it was last reviewed, and the claims lint
 *   reads this file like any other.
 *
 * English only for now: the page says so in the reader's language, and the
 * article is marked `lang="en"` so a screen reader pronounces it correctly.
