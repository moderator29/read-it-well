/**
 * Writing a review.
 *
 * The insert goes through the guest's OWN RLS-bound client. That is the whole
 * design: reviews_insert_own decides that the booking is theirs, that it is
 * CONFIRMED or COMPLETED, that it has actually checked out, that it is not a
 * tenancy, and that the review is being
 * attached to the listing the booking was for. The unique booking_id decides
 * that a stay is reviewed once. Neither rule is restated here, because a rule
 * enforced in two places drifts in one of them. The service role is never used:
 * a review written as the service role would bypass every one of those checks.
 *
 * The reasons read back before the insert exist to give an honest sentence
 * rather than a bare refusal. They are an explanation of the database's answer,
 * never a substitute for it.
 *
 * The host's notification and the safety classification of the review body are
 * both database triggers (reviews_notify_after_insert, reviews_scan_after_insert),
 * so nothing here writes a notification or a risk alert.
