/**
 * THE LEDGER'S VOCABULARY (Session 2, 7.5; feature register E5.1 to E5.3).
 *
 * Types and pure functions only, safe to import anywhere. The database is the
 * authority (`supabase/migrations/pending/b2_ledger.sql`): every rule here is
 * also a constraint there, and `events.test.ts` reads that file so the two
 * lists cannot drift.
 *
 * THREE POTS, three tables, never a column on one table (D50, D51):
 *  - customer_funds: the member's money at the provider. Never Vallo's.
 *  - vallo_revenue: commission, withdrawal fees, promotion. Never VAT.
 *  - marketing_float: Vallo's own money funding referral payouts.
 *
 * Append-only. A mistake is corrected by a NEW entry that names the one it
 * corrects and moves the opposite way; nothing is ever edited.
