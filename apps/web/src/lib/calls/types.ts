/**
 * VALLO CALLS: THE SHAPES EVERY LAYER SPEAKS. Client-safe, no imports.
 *
 * The database is the source of truth (`supabase/migrations/pending/vc1_video_calls.sql`);
 * these types are what the server actions hand the screens. Field names are
 * camelCase here and snake_case in the database; `snapshotFromRow` in
 * `lifecycle.ts` is the one place that maps them.
 *
 * Nothing in here can carry a provider token: `JoinCredentials` is returned
 * by one server action to the person joining, held in memory by the call
 * screen, and never written to a URL, a message, a notification or storage.
