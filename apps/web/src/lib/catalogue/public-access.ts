/**
 * THE SIGN-IN WALL, AS ONE SWITCH (STORE-P2-04).
 *
 * Whether a signed-out visitor may read the catalogue is the founder's
 * decision, not ours, so it is one server-side variable read at request time:
 *
 *   VALLO_PUBLIC_CATALOGUE=on   (also "1" or "true")
 *
 * Unset, or anything else, is the closed behaviour the product has today:
 * every catalogue screen sends a stranger to sign in.
 *
 * ON opens READ-ONLY the screens where the catalogue is browsed:
 * `/search`, `/stays` (and `/stays/search`), `/restaurants`, `/listing/<id>`,
 * `/stay/<id>` and `/restaurant/<id>`. Everything that is an account or an
 * action stays gated WHATEVER THIS SAYS, because the proxy only ever adds
 * these six first segments to the open set: `/u` and people search, messages
 * (including `/messages/new?listing=`, which creates a thread on GET), saved,
 * bookings, wallet, checkout, settings and every API route except the map's
 * pins (`PUBLIC_CATALOGUE_API_PATHS`).
 *
 * What a signed-out reader can see on those pages is decided by the database,
 * not by this switch: the `anon` role holds no SELECT on
 * `listings.address`, `businesses.address|phone|email` or
 * `accommodations.address`, so an exact address cannot reach a stranger.
 *
 * Anonymous page reads under the switch are counted per IP by the proxy
 * (`ANON_CATALOGUE_LIMIT` per `ANON_CATALOGUE_WINDOW_SECONDS`).
