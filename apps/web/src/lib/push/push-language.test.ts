 * A11: PUSH TEXT IN THE MEMBER'S LANGUAGE.
 *
 * The database writes every notification in English. The drain renders the
 * lock-screen text in the recipient's `profiles.settings.locale` from a
 * catalogue of machine drafts, all or nothing, with English as the fallback.
 * What is pinned: a known notification arrives in Hausa, Yoruba or Igbo with
 * the database's own facts carried across; an unknown one, or a known title
 * whose body has changed shape, arrives wholly in English; English and a
 * missing or unknown locale are untouched; every draft is recorded as a
 * draft; and the folded-backlog summary follows the language too.
