/**
 * WHAT THIS DEPLOYMENT CAN ACTUALLY SEND, AND WHO HAS TO SUPPLY THE REST.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL.
 *
 * Three push transports, three completely different credentials, and on the
 * day this was written this repository held NONE of them. That is not a
 * failure of the build; two of the three can only come from accounts the
 * owner holds and nobody else can create. What would be a failure is a queue
 * that quietly fails forever because nothing ever said which key was absent.
 *
 * So every transport asks this module first, the drain turns a missing
 * credential into a NAMED alert on the desk rather than into a retry loop,
 * and `describeCredentials()` answers the question "what is stopping push"
 * in one sentence a person can act on.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE THREE, AND WHICH OF THEM COSTS ANYTHING.
 *
 * WEB PUSH needs a VAPID key pair. THIS IS THE ONE THAT NEEDS NOBODY. A VAPID
 * pair is self generated, like an SSH key: no account, no signup, no money,
 * no company involved. `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` prints both halves
 * in about a second. The private half is a server secret and belongs in the
 * environment; the public half is compiled into the client and is meant to be
 * seen. Because it needs nobody, web push is the transport this build can
 * carry all the way to a real device without waiting for anybody, and it is
 * the one to prove the path with.
 *
 * FIREBASE CLOUD MESSAGING needs a service account JSON from a Firebase
 * project. Free, but it needs a Google account and a project created in a
 * console, so it is the owner's to make and nobody else's. It is required for
 * Android, and `google-services.json` has to be placed in the Android project
 * as well: the credential alone is not enough.
 *
 * APNS needs a `.p8` signing key, a key id and a team id from an Apple
 * Developer account. That account costs 99 USD a year and this repository
 * already records, in `ios/App/App/App.entitlements`, that the owner does not
 * have one yet. Until it exists there is no iOS push, there is no
 * `aps-environment` entitlement that will build, and no amount of code here
 * changes that.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTHING IN THIS FILE EVER RETURNS A SECRET, LOGS ONE, OR PUTS ONE IN AN
 * ALERT. It returns booleans and names of variables. The values are read at
 * the point of use, in the transport, and go straight onto the wire.
