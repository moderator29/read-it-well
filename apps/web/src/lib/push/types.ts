 *
 *   accepted  the service took it. This is 201 for Web Push and APNs, 200
 *             for FCM. It does NOT mean a handset lit up; it means the
 *             service that owns that handset has it. That distinction is
 *             real and this code never claims more than it knows.
 *
 *   gone      the service says this token is dead: 404 or 410 on Web Push,
 *             410 on APNs, UNREGISTERED on FCM. The token is retired.
 *
 *   failed    anything else. Retryable, or not, by status.
