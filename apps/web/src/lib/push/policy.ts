/**
 * EVERY DECISION ABOUT ONE QUEUED PUSH, AS A PURE FUNCTION.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE POLICY IS HERE AND NOT IN THE DRAIN, AND NOT IN SQL.
 *
 * The drain does input and output: it claims rows, posts to providers, writes
 * what came back. If the rules about who gets what and when were tangled into
 * it, every one of them could only be tested by standing up a database and a
 * push service. Here they are functions from plain values to a verdict, so
 * the awkward cases that actually bite (a window that wraps midnight, a
 * settings document written by a three-version-old client, eleven things
 * arriving during the night) are pinned by tests that run in milliseconds.
 *
 * It is also not in a migration, for a reason worth stating: policy in a
 * migration can only be changed by another migration, and this policy will be
 * argued about. The queue's trigger therefore decides exactly one thing, and
 * it is the one thing SQL should decide: whether there is any device to send
 * to at all.
