/**
 * THE DRAIN. THE ONLY THING THAT SENDS.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE FAULT THIS IS WRITTEN AGAINST, NAMED AT THE TOP SO IT CANNOT BE MISSED.
 *
 * This platform lost twenty-four days to a scheduled job that handed a
 * payload to something and reported success without ever reading the reply.
 * Every decision below is shaped by that: a delivery is settled by the STATUS
 * A PUSH SERVICE RETURNED, the status is written into `push_deliveries`
 * before the row is called anything, and the database itself refuses a
 * settled delivery that carries no status. If this file ever stops reading a
 * reply, the insert fails; it cannot quietly succeed.
 *
 * The second half of the same lesson: a queue nobody can see is a queue that
 * stops. `verdictFor` below turns this run into the shape `lib/cron/run.ts`
 * already reports, and a stuck or failing queue becomes a row in
 * `risk_alerts`, which `/admin/alerts` already carries a badge for. Push
 * failures arrive at a desk that exists.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE FOUR PLACES A DOUBLE SEND COULD COME FROM, AND WHAT STOPS EACH.
 *
 * 1. THE EVENT QUEUED TWICE. `push_queue.notification_id` is unique. The
 *    trigger inserts `on conflict do nothing`.
 *
 * 2. TWO DRAINS CLAIMING ONE ROW. The claim is a single UPDATE filtered on
 *    the states a claimable row can be in, with `returning`. Under READ
 *    COMMITTED the second drain's UPDATE blocks on the row lock, re-reads
 *    the row after the first commits, finds `state = 'sending'`, and matches
 *    nothing. A drain therefore acts only on rows its own UPDATE returned.
 *
 * 3. ONE ROW SENT TWICE TO ONE DEVICE. `push_deliveries` is unique on
 *    `(queue_id, token_id)`, and `attemptable` below refuses any device that
 *    already has a row unless that row is an outright failure with attempts
 *    left.
 *
 * 4. A REAPED CLAIM RESENDING WHAT IT ALREADY SENT. This is the subtle one.
 *    `private.push_reap_stale_claims` hands a dead drain's rows back, which
 *    would be dangerous on its own: a worker that sent and then died would
 *    have its work repeated. It is safe here ONLY because of the delivery
 *    table, and specifically because a delivery still in `sending` is NEVER
 *    retried. A row we never read a reply for stays as it is, is counted by
 *    `push_queue_health`, and is a fact somebody reads rather than a retry.
 *    The email outbox built alongside this reached the same conclusion from
 *    the other direction, by refusing to have a reaper at all.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * NOTHING HERE LOGS A PERSONAL DATUM. Not a token, not a title, not a body,
 * not an address. The vocabulary of every count, every alert and every error
 * is: queue ids, `device_ref`, platform names, HTTP statuses and machine
 * tokens. A device token is the worst kind of personal datum, because it is
 * also a capability, and it never leaves `push_tokens`.
