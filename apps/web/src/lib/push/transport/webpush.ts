/**
 * WEB PUSH, RFC 8291 AND RFC 8188, WRITTEN OUT RATHER THAN INSTALLED.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS IS THE TRANSPORT THAT MATTERS TO THIS BUILD.
 *
 * Of the three push transports, this is the only one whose credential needs
 * NOBODY. A VAPID key pair is self generated in a second, like an SSH key: no
 * account, no console, no company, no money. FCM needs a Firebase project the
 * owner must create and APNs needs a 99 USD Apple membership the owner does
 * not yet hold. So this is the path that can go all the way to a real handset
 * without waiting for anybody, and it is therefore the path the whole
 * delivery mechanism is proved on.
 *
 * It is also not a consolation prize. On the Android handsets this product is
 * built for, an installed web app gets push through exactly this route, and
 * iOS 16.4 and later grants web push to a site added to the home screen. It
 * is a real channel that reaches real phones.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THE CRYPTO IS HERE AND NOT `npm install web-push`.
 *
 * Adding a dependency to this repository is a thing to be announced, not done
 * quietly, and it buys three primitives Node already ships: ECDH on P-256,
 * HKDF through HMAC, and AES-128-GCM. What follows is the specification
 * written out with the reason for each step beside it. It is about ninety
 * lines and every one of them is testable, which a dependency's internals are
 * not.
 *
 * THE HONEST RISK, NAMED. Hand-written crypto fails silently: a wrong byte
 * produces a body that is perfectly well formed and that no handset can
 * decrypt, and the push service still answers 201 because the service cannot
 * read it either. A 201 therefore PROVES THE TRANSPORT AND NOT THE
 * ENCRYPTION. The only thing that proves the encryption is a notification
 * appearing on a screen. `webpush.test.ts` closes as much of that gap as can
 * be closed without a handset: it runs the receiver's half of RFC 8291
 * independently and decrypts what this file encrypts, which exercises the
 * whole ECDH, HKDF and AES chain in both directions.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE SHAPE OF A WEB PUSH REQUEST, WHICH IS TWO UNRELATED THINGS AT ONCE.
 *
 * 1. WHO IS SENDING. A VAPID JWT in the Authorization header, signed with our
 *    private key, telling the push service which application is asking. This
 *    is the part that stops anybody who scrapes an endpoint URL out of a
 *    database from pushing to it.
 *
 * 2. WHAT IS BEING SENT. A body encrypted to the SUBSCRIPTION's public key,
 *    which only that browser holds the private half of. THE PUSH SERVICE
 *    CANNOT READ IT, and that is the point of the design: Google or Mozilla
 *    carry the message without being able to see it.
 *
 * The two use different keys for different purposes and confusing them is the
 * classic defect here. The VAPID pair is OURS and is the same for every
 * subscriber. The p256dh and auth pair is THEIRS and is different for every
 * subscription.
