/**
 * NOTIFICATIONS YOU CAN ACT ON. V-53.
 *
 * A push that can only be tapped is a push that asks the person to work out
 * what to do next. For the moments where the next step is obvious, the
 * notification carries up to two buttons that go straight to it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVERY BUTTON OPENS VALLO. NONE ACTS FROM THE LOCK SCREEN.
 *
 * The entry asked for "Accept" to accept an inspection from the lock screen,
 * through a signed single-use token in the payload. That is not built, on
 * purpose: a button that commits somebody to a time, from a lock screen, on a
 * phone that may be in somebody else's hand, is a mutation made without a
 * session, and it would need a token table, a secret and its own abuse review.
 * So each button is a DESTINATION: it opens the screen where the action is
 * one tap away, signed in, with the person looking at what they are agreeing
 * to. The labels say where they go ("Open inspections", "Reply"), not
 * what they would do, so no button claims to have done something it has not.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE MOMENTS, and why only these.
 *
 *   message          "Reply" -> the thread.
 *   listing or agent, to /agent/inspections   "Open inspections" -> the
 *                    lister's inspections, where Accept and Suggest another
 *                    time live (the trigger writes these as kind `listing`).
 *   booking, to /bookings or /trips   "Open the booking" -> the booking,
 *                    where its details and the in-app map live (the
 *                    button never opens an outside maps app).
 *
 * Everything else carries no buttons: a tap on the notification is already
 * the right answer, and a button that repeats the tap is noise.
 *
 * Every href is re-checked by the same rule as the tap (`safeHref`), and the
 * service worker checks it again. Web Push shows at most two actions on
 * Chrome for Android; the list is capped at two here so the device never
 * silently drops one.
