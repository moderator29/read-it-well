/**
 * WHETHER THIS PERSON WANTS THIS PUSH, READ OUT OF A DOCUMENT SEVERAL
 * VERSIONS OF THE APPLICATION HAVE WRITTEN TO.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT EXTENDS RATHER THAN REPLACES.
 *
 * `/settings/notifications` has written four booleans into
 * `profiles.settings.notifications` since the settings page shipped:
 * `bookings`, `messages`, `wallet`, `marketing`. Those are read today by
 * `lib/email/recipients.ts` for email and by `private.notify` for the in-app
 * row. One boolean governed two channels, which was honest when there were
 * two channels.
 *
 * With push there are three, and one boolean per topic can no longer say what
 * people mean: plenty of people want a message in app and on their phone but
 * not in their inbox. So a `channels` object is added BESIDE the four
 * booleans, never in place of them, and the reading rules below are what keep
 * every document ever written by this product readable.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE READING RULES, IN PRECEDENCE ORDER. THESE ARE THE WHOLE FILE.
 *
 * 1. An explicit `channels.<topic>.push` boolean wins.
 * 2. Failing that, the old boolean for that topic wins, because somebody who
 *    switched Bookings off before this existed meant it, and they meant it
 *    about every channel they had.
 * 3. Failing that, DELIVER. A missing key, a malformed value, a topic nobody
 *    has a switch for: all of them mean the person never chose. This is the
 *    same failure direction `private.notify` states in the database and it is
 *    the right one, because the cost of a notification somebody did not want
 *    is annoyance and the cost of silence is a missed booking.
 *
 * The one exception to rule 3 is `marketing`, which is OFF unless somebody
 * explicitly turned it on. Consent to be marketed at is not something a
 * person gives by not having an opinion.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTHING HERE READS AN ADDRESS, A TOKEN OR A NAME. It takes a jsonb document
 * and a notification kind and returns a boolean. That is the whole contract,
 * and it is what lets every branch be tested without a database.

 * WHICH KINDS GO THROUGH QUIET HOURS AT ANY HOUR.

 * Only `wallet`, and the restraint is deliberate. The database already
 * refuses to let a wallet notification be silenced in app, on the argument
 * that money at risk is not a preference
 * (`20260804134543_...sql:17-22`), and extending that one existing decision
 * is better than inventing a second, different answer about what counts as
 * urgent.
 *
 * THE LIMITATION, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. `notifications` carries a kind
 * and no severity, so this cannot tell "your withdrawal failed" from "your
 * wallet was credited", and it wakes somebody for both. Waking a person for a
 * credit they were not worried about is a smaller error than sitting on a
 * reversal until morning, so that is the direction chosen. The real fix is a
 * severity on the event (proposed in `docs/archive/BUILD_07_LEDGER.md`),
 * rather than a guess made here by reading titles,
 * which would be a parser over a person's content and would break the first
 * time the copy changed.
