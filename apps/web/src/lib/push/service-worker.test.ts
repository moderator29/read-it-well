/**
 * WHAT A PERSON ACTUALLY SEES, AND WHERE A TAP ACTUALLY LANDS, ASSERTED
 * AGAINST THE BYTES THAT ARE SERVED.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THIS FILE READS `public/sw.js` AND RUNS IT. IT DOES NOT RE-IMPLEMENT IT.
 *
 * A service worker cannot be imported: it has no exports, it addresses a
 * `self` that does not exist in Node, and it is shipped as a static file
 * rather than compiled. The usual answer to that is to copy the interesting
 * logic into a module, test the copy, and ship the original. That is a test
 * of a thing nobody runs, and section 17 of the ledger is a list of them.
 *
 * So the real file is read off disk, evaluated against a recording `self`,
 * and its listeners are called. Every assertion below is about the exact text
 * that a browser downloads from `/sw.js`. Change the icon path in the shipped
 * file and this goes red; change it here and nothing happens, because there
 * is nothing here to change.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, SAID FIRST.
 *
 * It does not prove a notification reaches a device. NOTHING IN THIS
 * REPOSITORY PROVES THAT and nothing here implies it. It proves the worker's
 * decisions: what it builds, what it refuses, what it folds, and where it
 * sends a tap. The half above that (a real Chromium, a real `push` event, the
 * real notification the browser built from it) is
 * `service-worker.browser.test.ts`. The half above THAT needs a handset, a
 * push service and a VAPID pair, and is `docs/push/FIRST_NOTIFICATION.md`.
