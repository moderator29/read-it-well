/**
 * The two things a person wants from the device list, and no third.
 *
 * Turn one device off, because they sold the phone or do not recognise the
 * row. Or turn every device off, which is the one they reach for when a
 * handset is lost and they are not going to enumerate anything.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHAT THESE DO AND DO NOT AFFECT, because the screen has to say it too.
 *
 * This retires PUSH TOKENS. It does not sign a device out: that is
 * `/settings/devices` and `lib/security/sessions-actions.ts`, which end
 * `auth.sessions` rows. A phone that has been thrown off here can still open
 * the application, and a phone thrown off there can no longer be notified
 * only once its token stops being re-registered. They are two different
 * screens about two different things and the copy on both says so, because a
 * person who thinks they have locked a lost phone out and has only silenced
 * it is in a worse position than one who was told nothing.
