/**
 * THE SUPPLY SIDE, AS DATA. ONE VOCABULARY, READ BY EVERY SURFACE.
 *
 * Built the way `lib/trust/verification.ts` is built, for the reason that file
 * gives at its head: a ladder whose public description and internal checklist
 * are written separately ends up promising a reader something the reviewer
 * never looked at. The same is true of a role. Before this module there were
 * THREE role vocabularies in the tree and they disagreed with each other:
 *
 *   `components/roles/roles.ts`   renter | owner | professional, mapped onto
 *                                 `agents.type`, so a landlord and a one
 *                                 person letting agency were the same database
 *                                 row and were told on screen they were
 *                                 different things.
 *   `public.signup_role`          five values that the migration itself says
 *                                 "confer nothing".
 *   `verification_is_required`    gates verification on that self declared
 *                                 enum.
 *
 * And the AI assistant's system prompt described a verification ladder with a
 * phone rung, which has never existed, and omitted the payout rung, which is
 * the only automated one we have. One hardcoded paragraph, already wrong,
 * already shipped. That is what a second copy of this vocabulary costs.
 *
 * Client safe: it imports one other data module and nothing else, so the same
 * values reach the server, the browser, the assistant's prompt and the specs.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO PERSON ROLES AND THREE LISTING VALUES, AND THAT IS NOT AN INCONSISTENCY
 *
 * A firm's proof set is a SUPERSET of an individual agent's: identity and
 * mandate, plus incorporation and proof of association. A superset is a BRANCH
 * IN A FORM, not a role, and this codebase already implements exactly that
 * branch twice (`components/verification/kyc.ts` `stepsFor`, and
 * `lib/agent/application.ts`). Owner and agent are kinds of PERSON; a firm is
 * an ORGANISATION, already modelled as a `businesses` row with `kind` of
 * `agency` and a registration ladder of its own.
 *
 * But three values belong at the LISTING level, because "listed by the owner",
 * "listed by Chidi Okeke, agent" and "listed by Acme Properties Ltd" are three
 * different offers, and telling them apart is the whole point of the exercise
 * for the person searching.
 *
 * NO FOURTH ROLE, now or later. A developer's relation to what it sells is
 * OWNER plus an off plan disclosure, and `build_condition = 'off_plan'`
 * already exists. A property manager's relation is AGENT with a management
 * mandate. Both are a mandate kind and a flag.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OWNERSHIP IS A PROPERTY OF A PAIR, NEVER OF A PERSON
 *
 * `agents.user_id` is `not null unique`, so a role column on a person alone
 * makes a man who owns one flat and agents another unrepresentable. The person
 * axis answers "what kind of supply account is this"; the pair axis, a person
 * and a property, answers "what is this person to THIS property". This module
 * names both and conflates neither.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND IT IS DELIBERATE
 *
 * No statutory figure, no penalty, no percentage and no regulator's fee
 * schedule. `docs/research/ROLE_ARCHITECTURE_RESEARCH.md` reaches every
 * Nigerian legal claim through a search index rather than a primary source and
 * its honesty log says so, and HANDOFF 09 section 7 gates the LASRERA and
 * tenancy numbers on a lawyer's confirmation. So LASRERA is named here as a
 * field a person may fill in and as a thing a reader may filter on, and the
 * copy never states what the law requires or what it costs to ignore. The
 * ledger's "needs the founder" section carries the rest.

 *

 * of the three forms: `owner`, `agent` or `firm`. `agents.role` carries two
 * values, because a firm is an ORGANISATION and the person running it is an
 * agent with a firm behind them. Something has to narrow three onto two, and
 * until today nothing did: the approval path in `lib/admin/actions.ts` upserted
 * an `agents` row with `type` and `status`, granted `user_roles.role = 'agent'`

 * applications and the database could not tell them apart afterwards. An
 * approved owner became an "agent" row.
 *
 * The narrowing is written here, once, rather than at the call site, so that
 * the second caller cannot do it differently from the first. That is the same
 * reason `workspaceKindFor` in `registration.ts` exists.
 *
 * WHY NULL BECOMES `agent` AND NOT `owner`. A null `supply_role` is an
 * application filed before `20260922170000` added the column, and every one of
 * those came through the six step agent application. Answering `agent` says
