/**
 * THE THREE REGISTRATION FORMS, AS DATA.
 *
 * `GOVERNING-03`, `04` and `05` draw three forms of four screens each: the
 * owner, the agent and the firm. This module is everything about them that is
 * not a pixel: which screens each one has, which answers each question
 * accepts, what the fee arithmetic is, and what the server will refuse.
 *
 * CLIENT SAFE. It imports only `roles.ts` (the schemas and Zod stay in
 * `registration.ts`), and nothing that touches the network, so the three form
 * components, the server action and the specs all read the same values. A
 * second copy of any of this anywhere is a defect, which is the rule `roles.ts`
 * sets at its head and this file inherits.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE FORM DIFFERS, IN ONE SENTENCE, BECAUSE IT GOVERNS EVERY CHOICE BELOW
 *
 * The form differs because the proof differs, and the proof differs because
 * what can go wrong differs. An owner can let a property that is not theirs;
 * an agent can advertise a flat nobody instructed them about and collect four
 * inspection fees for it; a firm can be a letterhead. So the owner is asked
 * what they hold on the property, the agent is asked who they are and what
 * they charge, and the firm is asked for its registration and for proof that
 * this person speaks for it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE FACT THAT SHAPES THE OWNER FORM
 *
 * Most Nigerian land sits outside the formal register and most landlords hold
 * no title document at all. A form that requires a Certificate of Occupancy
 * therefore excludes the large majority of the owners this platform is trying
 * to reach, which would destroy the supply side the whole direction exists to
 * build.
 *
 * SO `none` IS A FIRST CLASS ANSWER. It is in the same list as the others, it
 * is accepted by the same schema, it reaches the same submitted application,
 * and the person who gives it finishes the form and is an ordinary lister. It
 * simply never earns the words "ownership verified". It is not a dead end, not
 * a lesser path and not a nag, and nothing in this module treats it as one:
 * there is no `requiresDocument` flag and no second chance screen, because
 * either of those would be the nag by another name.
 *
 * NEITHER FIGURE IS WRITTEN HERE AND NEITHER IS PRINTED IN THE PRODUCT. Both
 * reach us through a search index's summary rather than a primary source, and
 * they are held in `docs/archive/BUILD_07_LEDGER.md` section 5 for a lawyer. What ships is
 * the behaviour, which needs no citation.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AND WHAT IS NOT HERE
 *
 * No statutory figure, no penalty, no fee schedule and no percentage. LASRERA
 * is a FIELD a firm may fill in and a thing a reader may one day filter on,
 * and the copy never states what the law requires of whom or what ignoring it
 * costs, because the register was unreachable and every claim about it is
 * unconfirmed. `registration.test.ts` fails if a percentage, a naira figure or
 * a statutory claim reaches any of it.
