/**
 * What the consumer shell needs to render itself honestly.
 *
 * Four facts, resolved once in the layout rather than per surface: who is
 * actually signed in, how many notifications they have not read, and whether
 * this person has an agent workspace or an operations console to be shown a
 * door into.
 *
 * The last two are what stop the side navigation from lying. An Agent Mode
 * group offered to somebody with no `agents` row is a dead end four taps deep,
 * and a Console group offered to somebody with no staff role is a refusal
 * screen dressed as a destination.
 *
 * Both used to be wrong in the same way. The shell greeted every visitor as
 * "Guest" from a hardcoded constant whose comment said "until real sessions
 * land", long after sessions had landed, so a signed-in user was greeted by the
 * placeholder. And the rail declared a `badge?: number` that no item ever set,
 * so an unread count was rendered nowhere despite being one query away.
 *
 * Everything here fails soft. Navigation chrome is never worth taking a page
 * down for: an unreadable count is zero, an unreadable name is Guest.
