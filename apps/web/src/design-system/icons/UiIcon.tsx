/**
 * Tier one icons: the functional set for dense controls.
 *
 * The design direction calls for two icon tiers. Tier two is the 3D signature
 * object family, which carries a lit tile and reads beautifully from about 32px
 * up. Below that the tile collapses into an unreadable coloured square, so
 * dense UI needs a different instrument.
 *
 * These are stroked glyphs on a 24 grid. They inherit `currentColor`, so they
 * take the colour of whatever they sit beside, and they hold a real line at
 * 12px where a rendered 3D object cannot.
 *
 * THE SET WAS REDRAWN ON 29 SEPTEMBER 2026, ON LUCIDE GEOMETRY.
 *
 * The founder's references for the visual pass (`docs/design/references/
 * 2026-09-29/`) draw even line icons with round joins, the family SF Symbols,
 * Lucide and Phosphor all belong to. The previous set was hand-drawn glyph by
 * glyph over two months and it showed: live areas from 14 to 19 units, corner
 * radii from 1.2 to 4.2, three different ways of drawing a dot. The outlines
 * below are Lucide's (ISC, see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` beside this file),
 * copied in as path data with no runtime dependency, so every glyph now shares
 * one live area (2 to 22), one corner radius (2, 1 on small parts), one dot
 * (`h.01` on a round cap) and round caps and joins throughout. Where Vallo had
 * a drawing Lucide does not (the four property-type houses, the two-card
 * feed, the shorter third menu line, the naira-free fee glyphs: `survey`,
 * and the estate `gate` keyhole shield), it is drawn here to the same rules.
 *
 * THE WEIGHT WENT BOLD THE SAME DAY (the founder, 29 September 2026: "premium,
 * bolder, solid, clean and sharp", with pump.fun's app icons as the target,
 * `22-pumpfun-drawer-bold-icons.png`). Those draw about 2 to 2.25 CSS px at
 * 24 with round joins and a SOLID twin for the selected state. The set stays
 * on Lucide rather than moving to Ionicons (the web face of `@expo/vector-
 * icons`) or Phosphor Bold, because 2 is the weight Lucide's geometry was
 * DRAWN for: its counters, gaps and dot spacing are tuned at 2, so raising
 * the line to it makes every glyph cleaner rather than clogging it, and the
 * set stays one family with one licence. Ionicons' outline set draws 1.5 at
 * 24 (32 on its 512 grid), which is the weight being left behind; Phosphor
 * Bold is a heavier 2.25 on rounder, wider geometry that would have meant a
 * second redraw of all ninety glyphs in a week. `UI_ICON_STROKE_PX` below is
 * 2.25 at the 20 and 24 steps, scaled optically per size by `uiIconStrokeWidth`.
 *
 * `docs/ICON_SYSTEM.md` carries the scale, the weight and the filled twins.

/*
 * THE FILLED TWINS.
 *
 * A filled/outline pair is two drawings of one object, not paint poured into
 * an outline (which turns an open-stroke glyph into a blob). Each twin here is
 * built from its outline's own geometry in three layers:
 *
 *   body  closed shapes, painted solid AND stroked at the family weight, so
 *         the silhouette's outer edge lands exactly where the outline's does.
 *   cut   detail knocked OUT of the body at the same weight (a door, a tick, a
 *         fold), through an SVG mask, so the detail stays the family's line
 *         and not a hand-traced hole that thins at small steps.
 *   keep  strokes drawn on top as ordinary lines (a bell's clapper, a mast).
 *
 * `cut` children default to strokes; give one `fill="black"` to cut a solid
 * hole. A name with no twin ignores `filled` and draws its outline, so a call
 * site can never ship a blob.

 * THE WEIGHT. One weight, expressed as rendered CSS pixels rather than as a

 * renders thinner the smaller the glyph; the grid number is derived from the
 * size instead, and every stroked glyph on the platform renders this many CSS
 * pixels at every step. 2.25 is the bold, even line of the founder's
 * 29 September target (pump.fun's app icons, about 2 to 2.25 at 24), a
 * quarter over the weight Lucide's geometry is drawn for. It was 1.5 until
 * then, the thin line of SF Symbols regular, which read as hesitant beside
 * the bold type. `LineGlyph` and `SettingsGlyph` are name maps onto this
 * set (since 29 September 2026), and `FeatureGlyph` takes its width from
 * `uiIconStrokeProps`, so all of them follow the set's weight.
 *
 * SCALED BY SIZE, OPTICALLY. One fixed pixel weight at every step clogs the
 * small steps (2px on a 12px glyph is a third of a counter) and starves the
 * display step; one fixed grid number does the opposite. The rendered line
 * therefore steps with the size, on quarter pixels so it lands on the device
 * grid at 2x: 1.5 at 12, 1.75 at 16, 2.25 at 20 and 24 (the reference),
 * then a quarter more per step to 3 at 40.
 *
 * RAISED TO 2.25 AT 20 AND 24 (the ICONS3 audit, 29 September 2026). At 2
 * the nav, dock and detail-row glyphs still read a shade lighter than
 * pump.fun's beside 600-weight labels; the founder's "a bit more bold" is the
 * top of the 2 to 2.25 range those icons draw. 12 and 16 stay where they
 * were, because a heavier line there closes Lucide's counters.
