/**
 * Vallo brand icon.
 *
 * The content tier: one object per thing the product talks about. A shield, a
 * villa, a receipt. Navigation is mostly `UiIcon`, with one exception: since
 * Track M (25 September 2026) the side drawer rows and the dock's sub-nav tray
 * draw the glass object `GLASS_FOR` in `lib/nav/glass-glyph.ts` maps to each
 * destination. The two tiers still never share a row.
 *
 * THE ARTWORK CHANGED, AND IT IS THE REASON THIS FILE IS SHORTER THAN IT WAS.
 *
 * Until now the pack was soft matte white clay on white plinths, rendered as
 * opaque RGB with no alpha channel. The white had to be removed at paint time
 * with `mix-blend-mode: multiply`, and multiply against the night canvas
 * returns the night canvas, so every untiled object needed a near-white plate
 * painted behind it just to be visible. On the default theme that made every
 * content object on the platform a white sticker on navy: an app icon pasted
 * into a list row. Three of them in a column on `/bookings` were the clearest
 * example, and `/rent` showed two at once.
 *
 * `public/brand/glass` is the replacement: 103 objects in the logo's own
 * language, cut from the supplied sheets with a brightest-channel alpha key
 * rather than a brightness threshold, so the glow IS the alpha ramp and there
 * is no edge to see. They composite correctly on the navy canvas, on a card,
 * and on paper. So the blend mode is gone, the dark plate is gone, and
 * `.nf-brand-icon-ground` now paints nothing at all in the dark theme. That
 * was the acceptance test for the swap and it passed: see `docs/ICON_SYSTEM.md`
 * and `docs/archive/FRONTEND_REVAMP.md` section 2.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL TRUE, AND IT IS SIMPLER THAN IT WAS. A glass object is
 * see-through by design, so its interior alpha is partial, and that is correct
 * against the dark ground this platform has. It read thin on white paper,
 * which is why the light theme gave the untwinned objects a navy plate and
 * gave 23 marks a separately drawn daylight twin instead.
 *
 * LIGHT MODE WAS REMOVED ON 23 SEPTEMBER 2026 AND RESTORED ON 25 SEPTEMBER.
 * The removal deleted the plate tokens, the twin `<Image>`, the `LIGHT_TWINS`
 * set and the day and night classes, and none of them came back:
 * `.nf-brand-icon-ground` is a square wrapper with a radius and a little
 * padding and nothing else. The restored light theme styles the objects in
 * `app/css/light.css` ("THE ICON TILES"): no ground, a soft blue drop shadow
 * and an edge fade, so the object stands alone on white.
 *
 * The one fact from that work worth carrying forward, because it is about the
 * ARTWORK and not about a theme: no filter gets from one of these objects to a
 * paper version of it. The difference is which parts of the object are
 * transparent, and a frosted-white mark keyed off white inverts on a dark
 * ground. If a second palette is ever wanted, it is a render order.
 *
 * THE TILE IS OFF BY DEFAULT, and it used to be on.
 *
 * `tile` defaulted to true, so almost every call site drew a full glass chip
 * inside an `.nf-card` that already carried a gradient border, a rim and an
 * elevation shadow: two containers deep, six visual layers, around one 24px
 * icon. A tile is now something a surface asks for, and the answer is usually
 * no. Ask for it where the object is the SUBJECT rather than an ornament. An
 * icon beside a heading, inside a button, in a list row or on a stat tile does
 * not get one. Nothing in the tree asks for one today, and the 23 transaction
 * marks must never be given one, because they arrive on their own rounded
 * glass tile and a tile around a tile is the nested chrome this platform has
 * been removing.

/**
 * The 144 objects that exist as files under `public/brand/glass`. This list is
 * the artwork, not a wish: it is generated from the directory, so a name that
 * is here has a PNG and a name that is not cannot be typed.
 *
 * Alphabetical rather than grouped. The previous list was split into "actions
 * and concepts" and "property types" with a long comment between them, and the
 * split stopped being true the moment the transaction marks arrived: a receipt
 * is neither. One order that a reader can search beats three groups that have
 * to be maintained.
 *
 * FORTY ONE OF THESE ARE CROPPED FROM THE REFERENCE RENDERS, not sliced from
 * a sheet, on the direction's ruling that a glass object a governing render
 * uses and the sheets lack is cropped, keyed and filed under a name. They are
 * `RENDER_CROPS` in `scripts/icon-manifest.mjs`, which records the render and
 * the region each came from, and `docs/ICON_SYSTEM.md` lists them. Two things
 * to know at a call site. They are single objects with no light twin, so in
 * daylight they take the navy chip like the other 80. And they are NOT all
 * drawn at the same size: the wallet and the hotel are around 200 pixels at
 * source, the tiles 56 to 84, the landing rings and chips 36 to 48, so a
 * `-ring` or `-chip` belongs in a 24 to 48 slot and not in an empty state.
 * The manifest's `native` field says which is which.

 * inert where it sits because nothing references it. `brand-icon-assets.test.ts`
 * records that it is retained and unused so the next reader does not file it as

 * there: no glass object carries "several homes, recommended" or "one home,

   * content box to zero and rendered a 0 by 0 image. The result was an empty
