/**
 * The operator desk for hosts: read an application, decide it, record the
 * rungs, and put the venue in front of guests.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS ROUTE DID NOT EXIST UNTIL NOW, WHICH IS THE POINT OF IT.
 *
 * `lib/admin/business-actions.ts` and `lib/admin/business-queries.ts` have
 * been written, commented and complete for two days, and NOTHING IMPORTED
 * EITHER OF THEM. The decisions were all there; the door was missing. So the
 * only way a restaurant could ever reach the shelf was somebody writing SQL by
 * hand, which is exactly what happened to the first first-party venue (ledger
 * 12.5) and is not a process a founder can run while signing a venue.
 *
 * This file is therefore mostly a reading surface. It writes no rules: every
 * decision below is one of the six actions that already existed, and the one
 * new action (`publishRestaurant`) states its own gate in its own header.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT A REVIEWER IS SHOWN, AND WHY EACH PART EARNS ITS PLACE.
 *
 * The readiness list first, because it is the answer to the only question the
 * reviewer is actually here to settle: can this go live, and if not, what is
 * missing. It separates what BLOCKS publishing from what merely makes the page
 * thin, because those are different conversations with the host and running
 * them together is how a venue waits a week for a photograph nothing requires.
 *
 * Then the application: the representative, the CAC number to compare against
 * the free public search, the bank name the BANK returned beside the names on
 * the paperwork, the three consents as three dated facts, and the documents
 * behind short-lived signed URLs.
 *
 * Then the ladder, and then the decisions.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE BADGE. THIS DESK CANNOT LIGHT ONE ON A VENUE NOBODY CHECKED.
 *
 * `businesses.verified` is derived by trigger from the identity rung, so the
 * identity control is the only button in the product that can produce a
 * verified mark. It is disabled while no identity document is on file, and the
 * panel says plainly what the mark does and does not mean today: a restaurant
 * on the business spine shows NO verified mark on its own page under any
 * combination of rungs, because the page and the catalogue projection derive
 * that mark from a different column entirely (ledger 12.6). Recording a rung
 * here is a record about a person, never a decoration on a listing, and
 * nothing on this screen should be read as promising the host a badge.
