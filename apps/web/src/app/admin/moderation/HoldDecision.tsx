 * words are back. Removing does, and the reason is written onto the row so the
 * notification trigger reads it back to them verbatim. That is why the Remove
 * control stays disabled until something is typed: a takedown nobody explained
 * is the single fastest way to convince somebody a platform is arbitrary.
 *
 * Nothing here is optimistic. Both decisions reach a real person by
 * notification, so the row waits for the server and then refreshes.
