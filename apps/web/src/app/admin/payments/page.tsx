 * THE QUESTION THIS SCREEN ANSWERS. "Has the provider settled what it was
 * sent." Vallo holds no customer money (docs/MONEY_ARCHITECTURE.md), so the
 * one thing that can be outstanding is a charge the processor has not settled.
 *
 * The overdrawn-wallets table and the stale withdrawal holds that used to lead
 * this page are gone with custody: `admin_payment_health` still returns both
 * keys, always empty.
 *
 * Unsettled payments come last and are read-only: the reconcile route at
 * /api/paystack/reconcile is what re-asks the provider, and duplicating that as
 * a button here would give two code paths permission to decide a payment landed.

                      both the word and the colour, so every value that is not
                      FAILED collapsed into one word in one colour.

                      WHAT THAT WAS AND WAS NOT, STATED ACCURATELY. It was not a
                      live falsehood: `admin_payment_health` selects
                      `status in ('PENDING','FAILED')`, so only two of the four
                      ever reach this row today. It was a binary written over a
                      thing that is not binary, which becomes a false statement
                      about money the day somebody widens that `in` list, on the
                      desk whose whole job is finding false statements about
                      money. And it was English on a four-language platform.

                      The word comes from the column's own vocabulary and the
                      tone from `toneForStatus`, which maps all four. A status
                      the reader could not name is null rather than "PENDING",
                      and renders as "not recorded" in neutral: see
                      `transactionStatus` in `payments-queries`. F2-060.
