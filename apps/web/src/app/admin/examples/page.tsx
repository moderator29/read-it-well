/**
 * The example listings, as a set.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SCREEN. Forty-two seeded properties carry `is_demo` so
 * the catalogue is not empty while the product fills up. `/admin/listings` is a
 * review queue keyed on status, so those forty-two sit inside it looking
 * exactly like real supply, and the word "demo" did not appear anywhere in the
 * admin tree. Two things follow from that, and both are bad: an operator
 * reading the queue cannot tell seeded stock from a real lister's property, and
 * on the day real supply arrives there is no way to take the seeded set off the
 * catalogue short of running SQL.
 *
 * The count at the top is the honest measure of how much of the catalogue is
 * still furniture, which is a number the owner should be able to watch fall.
