/**
 * Taking the example properties off the catalogue.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, SAID BEFORE IT DOES IT. Retiring sets the listing's status to
 * SUSPENDED. The row stays exactly where it is, the catalogue and the map stop
 * returning it because `listings_select_published` only publishes PUBLISHED
 * rows, and putting one back is a status change rather than a restore from
 * backup. The confirmation says that in those words, because "retire" on its
 * own could reasonably be read as a delete and an operator should not have to
 * guess which one they are about to do.
 *
 * It is still shown as a count, a city breakdown and a named list before it
 * runs. Forty-two rows disappearing from the public catalogue is a change
 * anybody would want to have seen described first, even though it is reversible.
 *
 * No money moves here, so there is no amount and no counterparty to name. The
 * rule that a money movement states both is not weakened by this screen; it
 * simply is not a money movement.
