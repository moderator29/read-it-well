 * as long. Nothing has ever called either one and nothing has ever shown the
 * table. A stop was a thing the database could do and the platform could not.
 *
 * This is the surface for both halves of it. There is no separate confirmation
 * step, deliberately: a confirm dialog on a decision this size adds a click and
 * removes nothing, because the thing that actually prevents a mistake is seeing
 * what will happen, which is on the card. The reason field is the real gate,
 * and it is required.

 * AND IT HAD NO WAY TO FIND ANYBODY.
 *
 * Two lists of every approved agent on the platform, ordered by name, with no
 * search, no filter and no pager, on the screen whose entire job is "find one
 * person and decide about them". Twelve of the console's nineteen destinations
 * had the shared queue frame and this was not one of them. F2-055.
 *
 * The narrowing is in the query, on the first read, before the four reads that
 * fan out from it. See `getStopsDesk`.
 *
 * NO DATE RANGE HERE. The only date on this screen belongs to a stop, and most
 * of the agents listed have never had one, so From and To would narrow nothing
 * or silently empty half the desk. `dateable={false}` says so rather than
 * drawing two controls that do not work.
