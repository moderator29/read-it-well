 * Support: the honest end of the escalation path, and a support agent's
 * whole working day (docs/SUPPORT_STAFF.md).
 *
 * The door is `requireAdmin("support")`, read on the server before any
 * ticket is: an admin, or a staff member holding the support scope who has
 * acknowledged the handbook and proved their security key this session. The
 * one exception is a single ticket escalated to another desk, which a holder
 * of that desk may open by its link (the database decides, through
 * `support_ticket_escalations_for`); they see that ticket and no queue.
 *
 * A reply inserts a staff message and the database tells the member
 * (private.notify_support_reply). A ticket about being asked to pay outside
 * Vallo, or one escalated to money or safety, runs on the four-hour promise
 * /standards publishes; the rest on a day.
