 * ADMIN COVERAGE (13 October 2026; docs/ADMIN_COVERAGE.md).
 *
 * The console grew desks faster than its map: four reached only by Control K
 * or a link inside another desk, and a blocked-terms panel that said the list
 * "cannot be read from the console" while the function that reads it had been
 * live for a week. These hold the map to the tree in both directions: every
 * static admin page is on the rail (or is a named sub-page of a desk that is),
 * and every rail row opens a page that exists.
