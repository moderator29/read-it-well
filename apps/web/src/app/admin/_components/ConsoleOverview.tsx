/**
 * THE CONSOLE'S FRONT DOOR, DRAWN FROM COUNTS IT IS HANDED.
 *
 * The founder's item 5, in his words: "Going into the admin console should
 * land on the overview, every time, before any individual desk. Right now it
 * drops straight into an area. Overview first, then I choose where to go."
 *
 * WHAT USED TO BE AT `/admin`. A unified queue table: five readers folded
 * into one list, a tab strip, a filter bar and forty rows. It is a good
 * screen and it is an AREA - one way of working, chosen for you, before you
 * have said what you came to do. It has moved intact to `/admin/queue`, it is
 * the first thing this page offers, and it is the row directly under Overview
 * in the console rail. Nothing became harder to reach; it simply stopped
 * being what opening the console means.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNTS ARE A PROP. The page above this one reads them under the
 * admin gate and hands them down, which keeps this file free of the database
 * and lets the dev preview draw the same surface from fixtures. THAT IS THE
 * ONLY REASON. Nothing here decides what a number is; it decides how a number
 * is drawn.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER IS A DATABASE COUNT. `getQueueCounts` runs seven
 * `head: true, count: "exact"` reads under the same admin gate the desks use,
 * and this draws what comes back and nothing else. There is no trend, no "up
 * from last week" and no total-processed figure, because nothing in this
 * schema records a point in time from which such a number could be derived: a
 * count the database cannot produce is not printed. When the counts cannot be
 * read at all the page above says so rather than drawing zeroes, which is the
 * one lie a console of this kind must never tell - an operator who sees seven
 * zeroes goes home.

/**
 * The desks, in the order `nav.ts` argues for: safety first, then supply,
 * then the human queues.
 *
 * The key is the count key AND the copy key, so a tile cannot draw one
 * queue's number under another queue's name. The hrefs are the desks' own,
 * which is why `applications` goes to `/admin/agents` and `tickets` to
 * `/admin/support`: the dictionary names the WORK and the rail names the
 * DESK, and they were never the same word.
