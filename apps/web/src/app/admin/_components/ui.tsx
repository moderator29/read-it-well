/**
 * The console's shared furniture.
 *
 * Server-safe on purpose: no hooks, no client boundary, so a queue page can
 * render its whole list on the server and only hand the decision controls to
 * the browser. Everything here reuses the platform's own glass, chip and badge
 * classes rather than inventing an admin look, because the console is part of
 * Vallo, not a separate product.
 *
 * The pieces are handed out by `adminUi(t, locale)` rather than exported one by
 * one. Every one of them carries copy, and a page that had to thread "Not
 * given" through twenty `DetailRow` call sites would sooner or later miss one.
 * One call at the top of a page binds the locale and the dictionary to all of
 * them at once, which is what keeps a queue from ending up half translated.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE MOVED TO THE SPACING AND TYPE SCALES FIRST.
 *
 * Every screen in the console draws its heading, its empty state, its detail
 * rows and its metric tiles from here. Twenty pages were carrying `mb-5`,
 * `p-4`, `gap-3` and `text-[0.875rem]` because those were the values this file
 * handed them, so the console's rhythm was set in one place and it was set
 * against no scale at all. Moving this file moves all twenty at once, and every
 * page that stops hand-rolling a tile stops inventing a fifth padding value for
 * it.
 *
 * The type went UP a tier across the board. `text-[0.875rem]` on a detail value
 * and `text-[0.75rem]` on its label is a reading size chosen for a dense table,
 * and this console is not a dense table: it is where somebody decides whose
 * money moves, at eleven at night, and the old sizes made that decision harder
 * to read than the marketing pages that carry no consequence at all. Detail
 * values are `nf-body` now, labels are `nf-overline`, and the icons that go
 * with them grew to match.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The console no longer owns a status vocabulary.
 *
 * `Tone`, `statusTone` and `TONE_STYLE` used to live here, and were one of four
 * competing implementations across the platform, so the same MORE_INFO_REQUIRED
 * row was one colour in the admin queue and another in the agent's workspace.
 * Everything now routes through `toneForStatus` and `<StatusPill>`, which is the
 * single map; the console's job is to name a status, not to colour it.
 *
 * The two washes below are NOT a status vocabulary. They tint the round glyph
 * on an empty-queue panel and a checklist row, where the meaning is "this is

 * behind a glyph came from the retired reference brief and is not part of this
 * system, citing `RECOMMENDATIONS.md` D-2 and D-5, and it is worse than
 * decoration in the light theme: a soft brand tint on white reads as lavender,
 * which is a hue family this brand has banned by name.
 *
 * The argument for the plate was that it stops a lone glyph floating in the
 * middle of an empty panel, which is a real problem and a box is the wrong
 * answer to it. `ComingSoon.tsx` had already arrived at the right one: what
 * stops an object floating is its SIZE and the air around it. So the panel
 * glyphs went up a rung to 40, which is the top of `UI_ICON_SIZES` and exists
 * for exactly this, and the washes become ink.
 *
 * The checklist row's glyph went UP as well, from 14 to 20. Fourteen is not on
 * the scale at all - the rungs are 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40 - and it was only
 * that small because it had to fit inside a 24px disc. With the disc gone there
 * is nothing to fit inside, and a tick that decides whether an agent is

   * is not translation and is not pretending to be. It is strictly better than
