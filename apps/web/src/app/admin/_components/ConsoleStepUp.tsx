/**
 * THE CONSOLE'S SECOND FACTOR, AS STAFF SEE IT.
 *
 * Every admin and staff member confirms it is them with their security key
 * (the passkey on their phone or computer) before any desk opens, once per
 * sign-in and again after twelve hours. Somebody without a key is sent to set
 * one up first; there is no password-only way in.
 *
 * C14 (30 September 2026): somebody with no key that may open the console
 * (none enrolled, or every one revoked for the console after a lost phone)
 * enrols a new one right here, on the first-key proof the settings page uses
 * for a staff account: the emailed code, and the password for an account
 * with one (`beginEnrol`). Then the console asks for the new key at once.
