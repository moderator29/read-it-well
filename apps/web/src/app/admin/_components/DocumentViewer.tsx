/**
 * A person's identity document, read inside Vallo.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, ON THREE DESKS AT ONCE. `/admin/kyc`,
 * `/admin/businesses` and `/admin/agents` each rendered a signed Supabase
 * Storage URL in an anchor with `target="_blank"`. Tapping a NIN, a passport
 * or a CAC certificate opened it on `<project>.supabase.co`: a third party
 * origin, a tab that is not ours, a content security policy that is not ours,
 * an entry in the browser's history and a copy in its disc cache, and a live
 * signed URL sitting in our own DOM for the next ten minutes where anything
 * could read it and anybody could forward it.
 *
 * Nobody leaves Vallo. Least of all carrying somebody else's passport.
 *
 * The bytes now come from `/api/documents/<id>` on our own origin, behind
 * `requireAdmin`, uncached, with one audit row per view, and the signed URL
 * is never minted for a browser at all.
 *
 * WHAT IS HONESTLY NOT DONE YET, SAID HERE RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER. An
 * image is drawn in this sheet. A PDF IS NOT, and there is no in-app renderer
 * on this platform today. The sweep's answer is `pdf.js` drawn to a canvas
 * (`docs/research/ON_PLATFORM_SWEEP.md` section 8), and both routes to it
 * need a content security policy change that belongs to whoever is holding
 * `lib/security/csp.ts`: a same-origin frame needs `frame-src 'self'`, and
 * pdf.js needs a worker source. Neither was taken unilaterally.
 *
 * So a PDF is offered as a file from OUR origin instead, which is a smaller
 * departure than the one this replaces (no other company's page, no other
 * company's URL bar, no signed link to forward) and is still a departure. The
 * seam is `DocumentCanvas` below and it is one component wide.

            The optimiser CACHES what it optimises, on the server, on disc.
            This is one person's identity document, served uncached from our
            own route precisely so that nothing outlives the view, and putting
            it through the pipeline would write a copy of somebody's passport
            into a cache directory and leave it there. `unoptimized` emits the
            source directly with no `/_next/image` round trip, which is the
            same decision `RemoteImage` takes for a signed storage URL and
            `CoinImage` takes for remote art.

            `fill` rather than an aspect guess: a photographed document can be
            any shape and the box below is ours, not a stylesheet another
            worker owns, so there is no reason to promise a ratio we do not
