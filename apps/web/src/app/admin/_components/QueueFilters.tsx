/**
 * The console's one queue frame: find a row, narrow to it, page through.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THE CONSOLE HAD BEFORE THIS.
 *
 * Nineteen destinations. ONE search input across all of them, on
 * `/admin/bookings`. Zero status filters. Zero date ranges. Zero pagination.
 * No page read a filter parameter, applied a `.range()`, or offered a page
 * control, and `components/ui/Table.tsx` was used by the console exactly zero
 * times.
 *
 * At zero rows nobody notices, and every queue is at zero rows today. At a
 * thousand rows the console stops working, and `audit_log` already holds 482.
 * The console's whole job is to find one row among many and act on it, and it
 * could do that on one screen out of nineteen.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT IS A `<form method="get">` AND NOT A CLIENT COMPONENT.
 *
 * Because the answer belongs in the address bar. A filtered queue is then a
 * link an operator can send to the person who has to act on it, the back button
 * walks the narrowing backwards, a reload lands on the same rows, and the page
 * stays a server component that reads its own parameters. That is the same
 * contract discovery already runs on, and it is why the search on
 * `/admin/bookings` was right about the one thing it did.
 *
 * It also means this file has no hooks and no client boundary, so a queue page
 * keeps rendering its list on the server.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE STATUS CHIPS COME FROM THE REAL ENUM, EVERY TIME.
 *
 * `statuses` is passed in by the page, from the same union the query filters
 * on. Nothing here invents a status vocabulary, and nothing here can offer a
 * chip the database would refuse: four admin surfaces were already printing
 * raw column values as chip labels, and a filter that offered a value the enum
 * does not hold would be the same defect pointed the other way.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PAGINATION IS A CURSOR AND IT IS HONEST ABOUT WHAT IT KNOWS.
 *
 * There is no total and no page count, because a queue read that has fetched
 * one page does not know how many there are and printing "Page 1 of 40" would
 * require a second count query on every load. Next and Previous move an
 * offset, and Next is only offered when the page came back full, which is the
 * one thing the read actually knows.
