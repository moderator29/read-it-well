/**
 * The console's dense row table, built once (278CC66A at 390px, CDA4B82B at
 * desktop) so every desk inherits it.
 *
 * A row is: the reference, the type glyph on its tile, the title and the
 * person or place under it, a detail column on desktop, the status pill,
 * the submitted stamp, then View and the kebab. View opens the row's own
 * detail beneath it, which is the desk's existing review card with every
 * decision control it already had. The table therefore adds a way to scan
 * a queue without taking a single write path away from it.
 *
 * WHY A LIST OF DISCLOSURES AND NOT A `<table>`. A row needs to carry its
 * detail under it and a 390px screen cannot hold seven columns; a native
 * `<details>` gives the open and close, the keyboard and the state for
 * free, and the grid draws the columns the width allows. The header row is
 * drawn on desktop where the columns line up and hidden on the phone, where
 * every cell names itself instead: the type word sits under its glyph, the
 * pill carries its own status word, and the reference and the stamp read as
 * what they are.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. Bulk actions and an export button: no desk
 * has a bulk write and no export exists on the platform, and a control that
 * cannot act is the picture of a feature (rule 19). The kebab opens the same
 * detail as View, so it is never a menu of nothing.
 *
 * Server-safe: no hooks, so a desk keeps rendering its rows on the server.
