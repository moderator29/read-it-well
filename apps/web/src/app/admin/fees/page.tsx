/**
 * What the platform charges, what it has earned, and the controls to change it.
 *
 * Everything is zero today, by the owner's decision: the engine is built and
 * switched off until there is a user base, so that nobody already earning here
 * is ambushed by a rate they did not sign up to.
 *
 * ZERO IS RENDERED AS "NO FEE" AND NEVER AS A BLANK. That is the one rule this
 * page has to get right. A missing value and a deliberate zero look identical
 * in a table of numbers and mean completely different things: one is a decision
 * the platform made and can stand behind, the other is a bug. Every row here
 * says which.
 *
 * A rate change is an INSERT, never an edit, so the history below is the whole
 * story of what has ever been charged and nothing in it can be quietly revised.
 * That is also why a rate cannot start in the past: back-dating one would make
 * a fee already charged unexplainable by the table.
 *
 * THE EARNED SECTION IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE SAME QUESTION, and it is new.
 * A rate table says what the platform intends to charge. It cannot say whether
 * a single naira ever arrived, and until `public.platform_revenue` existed the
 * answer was that commission was withheld from payees and credited to nobody.
 * Showing the rate and the receipts on one screen is what makes the difference
 * visible: a rate above zero with nothing earned beside it is now a question an
 * operator can see rather than one nobody could ask.
