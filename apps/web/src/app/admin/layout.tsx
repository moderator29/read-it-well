/**
 * The console shell, drawn from the four admin renders (5EAA44CB, 01F7DFC7,
 * 8E9602E2, C1D98B3C): a lit glass rail on the left with the Vallo mark, the
 * twelve rows and Settings and the operator at its foot; a bar across the
 * main column with the search, the clock, the bell and the operator; the desk
 * below. On a phone the rail becomes a drawer behind the bar's menu button.
 *
 * ACCESS IS DECIDED HERE, ONCE, before a single queue is read. Signed out
 * or unconfigured gets the access screen; a signed-in account that is not
 * staff gets the ordinary 404 (29 September: the console's existence is not
 * confirmed to anybody who cannot use it); staff whose session has not proved
 * its security key get the confirmation screen and nothing else.
 * The gate is `requireAdmin` exactly as before; nothing about it moved.
 *
 * WHERE THE CONSOLE LANDS (rule R-E). Every door in the product links
 * `/admin`, and an arrival BY ADDRESS lands there too: the first request to
 * any desk in a browser session is sent to `/admin?next=<desk>` by
 * `EntryGate`, which the overview answers with "You were heading to" as its
 * first link. That includes the sign-in bounce, which returns to the desk
 * address and is caught here. See `_components/entry.ts`.
