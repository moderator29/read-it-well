/**
 * The console's error boundary.
 *
 * `admin/layout.tsx` performs the admin check before this segment renders, so
 * anyone who reaches this screen is already staff and the rail and header are
 * still on screen around it. That matters for what the boundary is allowed to
 * say: an operator can be told plainly that a queue read failed, because they
 * are the person who would escalate it.
 *
 * It still does not print `error.message`. On a console the temptation is
 * strongest - the reader is technical - but the boundary cannot know whether the
 * string contains a row, an email address or a connection URL, and the digest
 * finds the real log with none of that risk.
 *
 * The secondary action returns to the console overview rather than the guest
 * home: an operator whose queue failed wants the other queues, not the product.
