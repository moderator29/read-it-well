          NOT A BELL, AND NOT THE PENDING COLOUR.

          Same defect F2-057 names on `QueueUnavailable` and `CheckRow`, on a
          third object in the same console. `--nf-state-warning` resolves to
          `--nf-cyan-400`, which is the token `--nf-status-pending` is defined
          as, so a standing note about what these controls do was painted in the
          colour this product reserves for "still going through". And a bell
          means "you have a notification" everywhere else on the platform.

          NOT ROSE EITHER, which was the other candidate. Nothing here has
          failed and nothing is in flight: it is a note about the consequence of
          a control the operator has not touched yet. Painting it as an error
          would cry wolf on a screen an operator opens every day. The weight is
          in the sentence, which says the surface goes away from everyone
          immediately, and `info` is the glyph that means exactly this.
