/**
 * The standing desk.
 *
 * One badge is granted rather than earned, and the whole design of this
 * surface is about never letting those two look alike. A grant needs a
 * handle, a badge and a reason, and the reason is required because it is the
 * record of the decision: "why does this person have this" must be answerable
 * a year later by somebody who was not in the room.
 *
 * Every row states plainly who granted it. Every row in this list is a manual
 * badge, so every one of them was granted by somebody: a row with no name
 * against it is one whose granter has since closed their account, not one that
 * was earned. Taking it back stays available either way, because a badge that
 * can only be revoked by the person who granted it becomes permanent the day
 * they leave.
