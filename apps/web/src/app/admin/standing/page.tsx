/**
 * Standing: the badges a person grants rather than a trigger awards.
 *
 * Seven of the fourteen badges award themselves from event triggers, which is
 * the right way round: standing that can be earned should be earned. Exactly
 * one is marked manual_only, and the database refuses to store it without the
 * name of the admin who granted it (RM021).
 *
 * This is the desk for that one act, and the record of every time it has been
 * used. A feature with no admin control is a feature nobody can fix at three
 * in the morning; this is the control.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE RECORD WAS CAPPED AT A HUNDRED ROWS AND HAD NO WAY TO REACH ROW 101.
 *
 * No search, no badge filter, no date range, no pager, and a hard `.limit(100)`
 * underneath. This is an audit record: the question it exists to answer is "who
 * gave that person that badge, and when", and it could only answer it about the
 * hundred most recent grants. Twelve of the console's nineteen destinations had
 * the shared queue frame; this was not one of them. F2-055.
 *
 * THE CHIPS ARE THE BADGES THEMSELVES. Every other queue's chips come from a
 * database enum; there is no enum here, so they come from the `badges` rows the
 * read has already restricted itself to, which is the same guarantee by a
 * different route: a chip cannot offer a badge this desk would not show.
