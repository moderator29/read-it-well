/**
 * Restaurant reservations, under the console's eye.
 *
 * A host answers a request from their own board and, when they do not, the
 * guest waits on a table nobody has said yes or no to. This queue is where
 * an operator sees that and answers on the host's behalf, and where a
 * confirmed table can be called off by Vallo with a reason the guest reads.
 * Requests come first because they are the only rows anybody is waiting on.
 * The cards themselves are in `ReservationCard.tsx`, shared with the preview
 * harness so what is screenshotted is what the desk draws.
