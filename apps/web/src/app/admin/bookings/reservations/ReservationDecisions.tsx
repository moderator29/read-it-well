 * The three things an operator can do to a table, and the sentence first.
 *
 * Confirm and decline are the host's own answers taken on their behalf, so a
 * request that has sat unanswered gets one. Cancel is the platform calling a
 * confirmed table off. The two that take a table away ask for a reason
 * before the button, because the guest reads it word for word, and the
 * confirmation names the guest and the place so nobody confirms a button
 * rather than a decision.
