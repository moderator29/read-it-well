/*
 * THE INTRO PLAYS ONCE PER VISIT, AND ON A SLOW DEVICE WITHOUT THE BLUR
 * (Track M). This runs while the parser is still above the hero, so the
 * decision is made before the first frame of the headline:
 *
 *   `data-intro="seen"`   the headline has assembled once this session, so
 *                         it is simply there (landing-rooms.css);
 *   `data-motion-lite`    two cores or less, or two gigabytes or less of
 *                         memory: the depth arrival keeps its scale and fade
 *                         and drops the blur, as data saver does.
 *
 * Both are wrapped in try: storage can throw in a private window, and the
 * answer then is the full intro, which is the harmless default.

/*
 * The landing page: the true face.
 *
 * Built to the two governing images in docs/design/references, desktop
 * first and derived down to 390px (docs/DESIGN_DIRECTION.md section 2).
 * The section order is the fullpage render's, exactly:
 *
 *   1. The hero: the villa plate, the breadcrumb, the gradient headline, two
 *      CTAs, the city capsules, the floating listing card, the search pill.
 *   2. The stats band, printing only what `platform_stats()` returns.
 *   3. Everything you need in one platform: the ten-tile grid.
 *   4. The six-cell feature chip row.
 *   5. The community band with the layered cards and the Third party label.
 *   6. How Vallo works, four steps.
 *   7. Explore by category on the photo plates.
 *   8. The Stays band.
 *   9. Take Vallo with you.
 *  10. The footer with the newsletter field.
 *
 * What the renders show and this page does NOT: "10K+" and every other
 * invented count; "100% verified"; five social icons with no accounts
 * behind them; store badges linking to stores that do not exist; a partner
 * hotel dressed as a listing; and the garbled copy, none of which was
 * transcribed. Each omission is explained beside the section that would
 * have carried it.
 *
 * Product links go straight to the product. Browsing (`/search`, `/stays`,
 * `/listing`) is open to a stranger; the surfaces that need an account
 * (`/wallet`, `/messages`, `/assistant`) are guarded by `middleware.ts`,
 * which sends a stranger to sign in and back again with the destination
 * kept. The old `gatedHref` wrapper described a lock that no longer sits
 * where it said and is no longer used here.
 *
 * The sections and the data read live in `LandingBody.tsx`, shared with the
 * dev preview harness, so the page proven in a sandbox is the page shipped.
