/**
 * Route level error boundary: the brand moment.
 *
 * The lockup over the aurora plate, one glass card, an honest sentence, the
 * reference, and two ways on. Same anatomy as the sign-in render, because a
 * crash is the one screen where the product has nothing to show but itself,
 * and it should look like itself rather than like a browser.
 *
 * The plain-image variant (`PlainSystemMoment`): this boundary is in the
 * bundle of every route, so it must not bring `next/image` with it.
 *
 * The raw error never reaches the screen. The digest is surfaced because it
 * is the id support needs to find the matching server log, which is the
 * whole point of having one.
