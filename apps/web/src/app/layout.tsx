 * The fonts are declared in `css/fonts.css` and served from `public/fonts`,
 * not through next/font. That file explains which subsets ship and why; this
 * one decides which of them the browser is told to fetch before it needs them.
 *
 * Inter is chosen for coverage, not fashion. It carries the naira sign
 * (U+20A6), the Yoruba and Igbo dotted vowels (ẹ ọ ṣ ị ụ), the Hausa hooked
 * letters (ɓ ɗ ƙ ƴ) and the combining tone marks that stack on top of those
 * vowels. Most display faces break on that last requirement.
 *
 * Preload is per locale, because the face a locale reads is per locale.
 * `tokens.css` swaps the display stack to Inter for Yoruba and Igbo, since
 * Poppins cannot draw their vowels, so on those two locales Poppins is never
 * painted at all and preloading it would be a download nobody uses. In its
 * place they get the vietnamese subset, which is the only one carrying
 * U+1EA0-1EF9, and on those locales it is needed by the first heading.
 *
 * Everything in these lists was measured, not assumed: a browser sweep of six
 * routes at 390px and at 1280px fetched Inter latin, Inter latin-ext and both
 * Poppins subsets on every single load.

 * stylesheet asks for them, with `font-display: swap` covering the gap. The
 * first screen's body text is Inter latin and its heading Poppins 700 latin
 * (Inter vietnamese on the two locales whose headings need it). The naira
 * sign's own 1.2 KB face, `inter-naira` (V-78), is not preloaded either: the
 * stylesheet fetches it the first time a price is drawn, so English no longer

          THE NATIVE RUNTIME, MOUNTED (3 October 2026): this was the whole bug.

          `lib/native/boot.ts` has said for a while that this component "mounts
          this once from the root layout". It never did. No `<NativeRuntime />`
          existed anywhere in the tree -- not here, not in the (app) layout, not
          anywhere -- which meant `startNativeRuntime()` was never called, on
          any page, on any device, ever. Every plugin it starts, splash-hiding
          included, is reached only from inside that one call, so not one of
          them had run in production. A cold start on the native shell showed
          the branded splash and then nothing: not a hang, not a crash, not a
          slow network -- the one piece of code that could ever have taken it
          down was simply never in the page.
