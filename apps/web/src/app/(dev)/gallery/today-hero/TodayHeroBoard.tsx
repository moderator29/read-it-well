/**
 * THE TODAY HERO (reference 7033, north star section 10 G and H).
 *
 * The figure hero on the workspace home's navy band: "needs you today", large
 * and counting once on arrival, then the one next action as a single row. The
 * count is the sum of the count cards beneath it that were READ, so it always
 * decomposes into things the reader can tap; when no queue could be read the
 * caller passes `null` and the figure is not drawn at all, because a zero nobody
 * counted is a lie.
 *
 * THE COUNT IS THE VIEWER'S. It starts at zero (the idle state), and the buttons
 * raise it so the count can be watched arriving and then rolling; it is a test
 * value, not a queue. Captions and lines are slot names. The next-action row
 * links to this very page.
 *
 * Three states, in the order they are likely to be met: busy with a next action,
 * idle (nothing waits, so no row), and unread (null, nothing drawn).
