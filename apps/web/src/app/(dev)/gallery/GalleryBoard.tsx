        note="227 spacing utilities in the product sit between two rungs, and these four are 176 of them. Each row shows the value as written between the rung below and the rung above, on the same box at the same width. The question is not whether the scale is tidy, it is whether you can see the middle box differ from the two beside it: if you cannot, 176 call sites should move to the nearest rung and the scale stays six steps at the bottom; if you can, the scale is too coarse there and the product has been telling us so 176 times. The 20px row is the one to look at hardest, because 39 of its 61 uses are card padding and it sits in the only doubled gap in the ladder, 16 to 24."
