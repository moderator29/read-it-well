/**
 * THE SHARE SURFACE, BOTH HALVES, AGAINST FIXTURES.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY A HARNESS IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR THIS ONE.
 *
 * Every per-property check on this platform refuses, because all 64 published
 * listings are examples and `is_demo = false` sits inside the comparables
 * predicate, and the area report is empty nearly everywhere for the same
 * reason. So the ANSWERED half of this surface - the button, the sheet, the
 * card and the image - cannot be reached from the live product at all. A
 * surface that cannot be reached is a surface nobody has looked at, which is
 * how a share enum, a share table and a server action shipped with no button,
 * no destination and no image in the first place.
 *
 * Both states are drawn side by side, deliberately: the one a person meets
 * today, and the one the feature is for.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE BUTTON HERE WRITES TO THE LIVE TABLE, AND THAT IS CORRECT.
 *
 * `shareAreaPrices` is the real server action, so pressing it mints a real
 * row. That is the point: a preview whose control is stubbed proves the
 * layout and nothing else, and the thing worth proving here is that the whole
 * path works and that the artefact it produces carries no address. The row it
 * writes carries a neighbourhood name, a type, a bedroom count and three
 * figures, because that is all `price_check_shares` has columns for.
