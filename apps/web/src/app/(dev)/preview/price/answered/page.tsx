/**
 * AN ANSWERED RANGE, WHICH NO LIVE CHECK CAN PRODUCE TODAY.
 *
 * Every listing on this project is an example and `is_demo = false` sits in the
 * comparables predicate, so the answered branch of this surface is
 * unreachable in the product until real supply arrives in one place. It is
 * still a designed screen and it is drawn here.
 *
 * WHAT TO LOOK AT, because it is the ruling rather than a preference: THE
 * MIDPOINT IS NOT SET LARGER THAN THE BOUNDS. A range whose middle is
 * emphasised is a point estimate with decoration, which is the thing this
 * feature refuses to build. The basis line sits directly under the figure at
 * body-small and is never behind a tap. The confidence row is one blue at two
 * fills and a muted outline, never green, amber and red.
