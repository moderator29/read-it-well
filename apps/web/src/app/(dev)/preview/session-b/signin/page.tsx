 *
 *   ?state=chooser   the one screen, as live, with a notice and the doors
 *   ?state=finish    "Finish setting up" for a new Google account (B-2),
 *                    with the provider's name filled in
 *   ?state=google    an address whose account signs in with Google
 *   ?state=none      an address no account uses (the plain password step)
 *   ?state=refused      a password the server refused ("do not match")
 *   ?state=unconfirmed  an address not yet confirmed
 *   ?state=throttled    the per-connection or per-address limit tripped
 *   ?state=deactivated  an account in its deletion grace window (the real
 *                       notice, with its link to restore)
 *   ?state=fields       the server's field errors on both fields
 *
 * Proofs taken here are fixture-backed and the ledger says so.
