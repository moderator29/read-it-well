/**
 * G2's screenshot harness: every glass object cropped from the reference
 * renders, on the four real grounds, at the three sizes the product uses.
 *
 * The first block is the proof that fits one 390 by 844 viewport: all objects
 * at 32 on canvas, card, elevated and the glass card, side by side, so one
 * dark shot and one light shot show the cutout on every ground at once. The
 * header is one short line and the caption sits under the grid for exactly
 * that reason: 21 rows of 32 have to clear the fold. The
 * sections below repeat each ground at 32, 48 and 96 with the object's name,
 * its source render and its size at source, for scrolling and for anchored
 * shots (`#canvas`, `#card`, `#elevated`, `#glass`).
 *
 * Theme follows the document, as everywhere: the light shot is the light
 * theme, where an untwinned object sits on the navy chip `--nf-icon-ground`
 * paints behind it. Never the proof of the ONE LAW, only the proof of the look.
