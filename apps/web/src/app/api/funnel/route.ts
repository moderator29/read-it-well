/**
 * A6. The funnel beacon. `navigator.sendBeacon` posts `{ step, door }`; the
 * visit id rides in the session cookie. Only the browser-side steps are
 * accepted here (landing view, get started, the sign-up form's steps); the
 * others are recorded by the server where they happen. Always 204, so a
 * page learns nothing from it. The body is capped at 512 bytes and only a
 * known step name is kept; it is rate limited per address and per visit so
 * it cannot be used to fill the table, and the table itself keeps one row
 * per visit per step (a unique index).
