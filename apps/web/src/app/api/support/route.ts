 * exists to send somebody to, a ticket event carrying the real VAL-SUP
 * reference when it escalates, then done. Without an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY the

 * guarding. One house pattern for calling Claude, not two.
 *
 * The tools are the interesting part. Every personal read runs on the caller's
 * own Row Level Security client, resolved once here and passed down, so the
 * model can only ever see the record of the person it is talking to. See

   * renting, buying and selling" describes a directory. The position as of 22
   * September is one sentence and it is the first thing this agent should
   * hold: Vallo does not remove the agent, it removes the runaround, which is
   * agent fees stacked on agent fees, a chain of agents on one property, and
   * a cost nobody will state until somebody has spent a Saturday in traffic.
   *
   * The second is the ladder. This prompt typed it out as "phone, identity
   * document, address and a physical inspection". THERE IS NO PHONE RUNG AND
   * THERE NEVER WAS, and the payout rung, which is the only automated check
   * this platform has, was missing entirely. The concierge at
   * `api/assistant/route.ts` carried the same wrong sentence and was fixed by
   * reading `lib/supply/roles.ts`; this second copy was missed, which is the
   * whole argument for a mechanism over a habit. So it is the same call here,
   * built from `lib/trust/verification.ts`, which is what `private.agent_tier`
   * counts. The moment a rung changes, both prompts change with it.
