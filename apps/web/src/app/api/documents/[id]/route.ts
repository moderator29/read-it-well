/**
 * GET /api/documents/[id]
 *
 * One uploaded identity or business document, streamed from OUR origin to a
 * reviewer who has proved they are staff.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The three review desks used to render a signed Supabase
 * Storage URL in an anchor with `target="_blank"`. A person's NIN opened on
 * `supabase.co`, in a tab outside our chrome, outside our content security
 * policy and outside the audit trail, and the signed URL sat in the DOM where
 * it could be copied out and used by anyone for the next ten minutes. Nobody
 * leaves Vallo, and a document somebody trusted us with least of all.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT, IN ORDER OF HOW BADLY THEY GO WRONG.
 *
 *   1. WHO. `requireAdmin` is the console's single door and it runs first,
 *      before the id is even looked at. The service role client is created
 *      only after it passes, so an unauthorised caller never causes a
 *      privileged read of anything.
 *
 *   2. WHAT TYPE. The bytes were chosen by the person who uploaded them. An
 *      allowlisted type from the stored extension, plus `nosniff`, plus an
 *      attachment disposition for anything unrecognised, is what stops an
 *      uploaded document being served back as script on our own origin. See
 *      `lib/admin/documents.ts`.
 *
 *   3. WHAT IS KEPT. `private, no-store` on the way out and no signed URL on
 *      the way in. Nothing lands in a shared cache, and nothing outlives the
 *      view, which is the whole difference between this and a signed link a
 *      reviewer can paste into a message.
 *
 *   4. WHAT IS WRITTEN DOWN. One audit row per view, carrying who looked and
 *      which row they looked at, and NOT the storage path, the file name, the
 *      subject's name or any number on the document. Rule 16. The trail
 *      answers "who read this person's passport, and when", which is exactly
 *      what a third party tab could never answer.
 *
 * A refusal is a plain sentence, not JSON, because the only caller is an image
 * element or a frame inside the viewer and neither reads a body.
