/**
 * The scheduled money reconciliation.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN HTTP ENDPOINT AND NOT A pg_cron JOB. Six pg_cron jobs already
 * run on this database and not one of them touches money. Three of the four
 * checks reconciliation has to make can only be made from here, because they
 * require asking PAYSTACK what it actually charged and what became of each
 * transfer. Postgres cannot do that. The database-side halves already exist and
 * have never been called: private.wallets_overdrawn() and
 * private.stale_withdrawal_holds(). This job calls their equivalents on every
 * run, so the two checks that could have run in the database for months
 * actually run now.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, EVERY RUN:
 *  1. Asks Paystack for every successful charge in the window and compares them
 *     against wallet_entries and transactions. A funding gap is posted; a
 *     booking gap is reported loudly and left for a human.
 *  2. Asks Paystack what became of every PENDING withdrawal hold older than the
 *     timeout, and settles or releases each one on the processor's answer. This
 *     is the only thing standing between a lost transfer webhook and somebody's
 *     balance being held forever.
 *  3. Reports any wallet whose derived balance has gone below zero.
 *
 * HOW IT IS AUTHENTICATED. A bearer token compared in constant time against
 * RECONCILE_CRON_SECRET, which is exactly the header Vercel Cron sends. When
 * the secret is not set the endpoint refuses everything: an unauthenticated
 * endpoint that can move money is worse than a job that does not run, and a
 * job that does not run says so in the log on every attempt.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS. A summary with counts and kobo, never a customer email and
 * never a raw processor payload. Non-2xx when the run could not happen, so a
 * scheduler's own failure log is honest about it.
 *
 * DEFAULT IS DRY. `?apply=1` is required before anything is written, so the
 * first run against a live database can only ever report. Wire the schedule
 * with apply once a dry run has been read.
 *
 * IT IS ON THE SCHEDULE NOW, AND IT WAS NOT. `apps/web/vercel.json` carried
 * four crons, all of them BA's lifecycle sweeps, and this route was not among
 * them: nothing on Vercel and nothing in pg_cron called it, so the job that
 * recovers a lost webhook, settles a stranded withdrawal hold and reports an
 * overdrawn wallet had never run at all. Every paragraph above described a
 * schedule that did not exist. It is `10 * * * *` from this commit, hourly,
 * between the hold sweep at :05 and the pg_cron watch at :20.
 *
 * AND IT IS WIRED DRY, DELIBERATELY. The path in vercel.json carries no
 * `apply=1`, so the hourly run reports and alerts and writes NOTHING, which is
 * what this file's own instruction above asks for: read a dry run first. The
 * lead flips it by appending `?apply=1` to the cron path once a dry run has
 * been read against the live project. Until then the desk hears about a gap
 * and a person closes it by hand, which is strictly better than the nothing
 * that was there before and strictly safer than a sweep nobody has watched
 * moving money on its own.
