/**
 * Where the browser posts a crash, and the only way a client error reaches
 * the reporter.
 *
 * It exists so that `SENTRY_DSN` never leaves the server and so that every
 * outbound report, from either side of the product, passes through the one
 * scrubber in `lib/observability/scrub.ts`. `lib/observability/client.ts`
 * explains the choice from the browser's end.
 *
 * ## This is an unauthenticated POST endpoint, so it is deliberately tiny
 *
 * Exactly the shape `api/csp-report` settled on, for exactly the same
 * reason: a crash is reported by the browser of somebody who may not be
 * signed in, often on the very screen that failed, so it cannot require a
 * session. The mitigations are shape rather than authentication.
 *
 * - **It stores nothing.** No table, no row, no growth.
 * - **The body is capped** and anything larger is dropped unread.
 * - **Only five fields are read**, each bounded, and the rest of the body is
 *   ignored. A caller cannot choose what appears in a report beyond a known
 *   shape, and the scrubber redacts even that.
 * - **Identical reports are throttled**, in this route and again in the
 *   reporter, so one render loop is one report.
 * - **Nothing is logged.** The raw body never reaches a log line, which is
 *   what keeps rule 16 true for a payload we did not write.
 *
 * It answers 204 to everything, including malformed input and an
 * unconfigured reporter. There is no legitimate caller to help by returning
 * an error, and a reporting endpoint that argues with the browser gets
 * retried.
