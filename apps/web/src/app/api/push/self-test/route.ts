/**
 * POST /api/push/self-test. Send to MY OWN devices and tell me exactly what
 * the push service said.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THIS IS THE PROOF TOOL, AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS BUILD COULD NOT
 * DO FROM A CONTAINER.
 *
 * Everything else here is proved: the encryption round trips against an
 * independent implementation of the receiver, the queue's idempotency is
 * proved against the live database, the policy is thirty tests. THE ONE THING
 * THAT CANNOT BE PROVED WITHOUT A HANDSET IS THAT A NOTIFICATION APPEARS ON A
 * SCREEN. No amount of code closes that gap. This route closes it in about a
 * minute, from the device itself, for whoever is holding one.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES WHEN IT ANSWERS 201: that the credentials are right, that
 * the VAPID signature was accepted, that the endpoint is live, and that the
 * push service has taken the message. WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE: that the
 * handset could decrypt it. A push service cannot read the body either, so it
 * accepts a ciphertext no browser can open exactly as cheerfully as a good
 * one. THE SCREEN IS THE ONLY PROOF OF THAT, which is why the response says
 * so in as many words rather than declaring victory on a status code.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * IT DELIBERATELY BYPASSES THE QUEUE.
 *
 * A diagnostic that goes through the queue tells you about the queue when
 * what you are asking about is the transport. This calls the transport
 * directly, so a failure has exactly one possible location. It writes no
 * `push_queue` row and no `push_deliveries` row, which also means it cannot
 * leave test rows in a live product table.
 *
 * ONLY EVER TO YOURSELF. There is no parameter naming a recipient and there
 * is no branch that could reach one. It reads the devices of the person in
 * the session and nobody else's, so the worst it can be turned into is a way
 * of notifying yourself.
