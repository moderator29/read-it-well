/**
 * `/agent/listings/<id>/promotion`: A LISTING'S PROMOTION RESULTS (D3, D60;
 * `VALLO_PROMOTION.md`, "The measurement surface"; F4's ten figures).
 *
 * LINKED, AND SELLING NOTHING. It was linked from nowhere and the founder could
 * not find it; it now opens from the Promote action on a live listing's row
 * and from `/agent/promotion` (the rail's and the dashboard's door), both
 * through `lib/promotion/links.ts`. Promotion still cannot be sold until the
 * company payment account exists (D38), and Session 2's inventory and
 * purchase do not exist, so buying says so. What this page CAN show is real:
 * the listing's own last thirty days, read through the lister's own client
 * (`readListingMeasurement`), labelled as what it did without promotion. A
 * figure the lister cannot read reads "No data" with its reason, never a
 * zero (`lib/promotion/measurement.test.ts`). The split by where an
 * impression was served is not recorded yet, and the page says so.
 *
 * Then the tiers by reach with price, days and naira a day, the published
 * front door count, and no pay button (`PromotionPurchase`).
 *
 * It never says what a promotion "will get you": no projection, average or
 * "listings like yours" figure is computed anywhere, so none can be printed.
 * The first visit shows promotion's first run once (`gateFirstRun`), carrying
 * this page as `next`, so the run's third screen reads this listing.
