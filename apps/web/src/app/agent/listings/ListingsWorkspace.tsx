/**
 * The agent's listings workspace.
 *
 * Cards grouped by where each listing stands, because that is the question an
 * agent actually has: what is earning, what is waiting on us, what is waiting
 * on them. Sending for review and taking a listing down go through a confirm
 * sheet and then a router refresh, so the list always re-renders from the
 * database rather than from an optimistic guess. Unmet quality requirements
 * come back from the submit action and are shown in the sheet, in the same
 * words the wizard checklist uses.
 *
 * DELETING A DRAFT OPENS NOTHING (inbox item 26). It used to raise the same
 * confirm sheet, which asks the question in the wrong direction: a dialogue
 * defends against the tap somebody meant to make, and the tap that needs
 * defending against is the one they did not. The row leaves immediately, its
 * slot offers the way back for six seconds, and NOTHING REACHES THE SERVER
 * until that offer runs out. Which matters here more than it does on a
 * shortlist: the action deletes the row and its photos out of storage, so
 * there is nothing to put back afterwards. The undo has to come first or it
 * cannot exist.
 *
 * Leaving the screen inside the window commits the delete rather than
 * cancelling it, because the agent asked for it and walking away is not a
 * change of mind. Closing the tab outright is the one case that will not
 * land, and the draft simply survives.
 *
 * All copy arrives from the page as a dictionary slice, so the workspace reads
 * in the agent's language, including the status vocabulary.
