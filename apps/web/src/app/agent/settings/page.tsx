/**
 * /agent/settings: what a host controls about their own account.
 *
 * This was an eleven-line coming-soon stub, and the one thing it should have
 * carried was already half built elsewhere: the notification switches on
 * /settings wrote to profiles.settings and nothing read them. Now that
 * private.notify and the email recipient resolver both honour that document,
 * the switches genuinely govern what reaches a host, so they belong where a
 * host works as well as where a guest does. There is one preference document
 * per account; this is a second door to it, not a second copy.
 *
 * The trading identity is deliberately read-only. It is the name Vallo
 * verified, it appears on every listing and every thread, and letting an
 * approved host rewrite it after approval would make the verified badge mean
 * nothing. The page says that plainly and gives the route to change it.
