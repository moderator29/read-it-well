/**
 * Agent Mode's error boundary.
 *
 * Agent Mode has no `layout.tsx` - every page renders `AgentShell` itself - so
 * unlike Personal Mode and the console, this boundary genuinely does replace the
 * whole screen including the rail. It is therefore written as a standalone
 * surface rather than as a panel inside chrome that is not there.
 *
 * The consequence shapes the actions: an agent who lands here has lost their
 * navigation, so the secondary action returns them to the dashboard, which is
 * the one route that rebuilds the shell. Sending them to the guest home instead
 * would drop them out of Agent Mode entirely.
 *
 * The copy is written for someone whose livelihood is on the other side of this
 * screen: it says what did not happen, states plainly that nothing was lost, and
 * never shows them a stack trace.
