/**
 * /agent/messages: the host side of conversations that were already live.
 *
 * Agents have been receiving real threads under RLS since messaging shipped and
 * could only read them at /messages, the guest surface, with no host framing.
 * Worse, the navigation carried a hardcoded unread badge of 3 pointing here, at
 * a placeholder, so every agent saw three unread messages permanently and could
 * never clear them. This closes both.
 *
 * Shaped like /agent/earnings and /agent/bookings: the server page resolves who
 * is asking, reads under their own RLS-bound client, and hands the result to a
 * plain rendering component. Replying happens on the existing thread route
 * through the existing sendMessage action, so there is no second composer and
 * no second write path to keep in step.
