/**
 * /agent/analytics: what the host's properties have actually done.
 *
 * The last AgentComingSoon stub in the workspace, and the one it was most
 * tempting to fill with a demonstration. A placeholder chart on an analytics
 * screen is not a placeholder in the sense the other stubs were: a host reads
 * it as their own performance and prices a flat, declines a guest or borrows
 * money on the strength of it. So the screen ships with real reads or with
 * nothing, and the empty state is written to be read rather than to be
 * replaced.
 *
 * Shaped exactly like /agent/bookings and /agent/earnings: the server page
 * resolves who is asking, reads under their own RLS-bound client, and hands
 * the figures to a plain rendering component. Nothing here mutates, so the
 * workspace stays a server component with no client JavaScript to ship, and
 * there is no revalidation path to think about.
