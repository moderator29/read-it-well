/**
 * /agent/verification: where this agent stands, and what the next rung wants.
 *
 * This was an `AgentComingSoon` stub, and the gap it left was not cosmetic. The
 * ladder behind it has existed and worked for a while: four rungs in
 * `agent_verification_checks`, a tier derived by `private.agent_tier`, and an
 * admin console that awards them. What did not exist was any way for the person
 * being judged to see the judgement. A host climbing the one ladder that decides
 * how much of the platform they can use had to be told over the phone, and a
 * host whose rung was FAILED had no way at all to learn why.
 *
 * Three things this page will not do, each of which was the tempting version:
 *
 * 1. **It does not invent a submission flow.** There is no "upload your ID
 *    here" control, because nothing behind this page accepts one: the evidence
 *    for every rung already arrived with the application, and a rung is a
 *    decision a member of staff records after looking at it. A button that
 *    posted a document nowhere would be a worse lie than silence.
 * 2. **It does not recompute the tier.** `private.agent_tier` owns that, gaps
 *    and all, and a second implementation here would eventually disagree with
 *    the badge on the agent's own listings.
 * 3. **It does not soften a failure.** A failed rung says failed, in the same
 *    weight as a passed one, with the reviewer's note in full underneath.
