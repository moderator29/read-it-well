/**
 * The signed-in agent's real dashboard.
 *
 * Live counts, never seeded ones. There is deliberately no month-over-month
 * delta on the figures: the platform has no history to compare against yet,
 * and an invented trend arrow would be a lie dressed as a number.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ELEVEN SURFACES BECAME FOUR
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This screen was five stat cards, two panels each carrying its own heading
 * INSIDE its own border, and four square quick-action cards: eleven bordered,
 * rounded, shadowed rectangles down one column on a phone, for what is really
 * four groups of related things. The rule is one surface per GROUP, not one
 * per item, and it is most of why the reference platforms' screens read as
 * calm while carrying the same amount.
 *
 * So the five figures are one surface of rows. The listing breakdown is one
 * surface of rows with its heading OUTSIDE it. The stays are rows. The quick
 * actions are rows. Nothing is nested and no heading sits inside a card.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INSPECTIONS COME FIRST, AND THAT IS THE PRODUCT ARGUMENT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In this market an inspection is the deal. An annual tenancy is agreed after
 * somebody has stood in the flat; a sale is agreed after somebody has walked
 * the land. Until now the platform could not represent that step at all - it
 * lived as sentences inside a chat thread, which meant an agent with nine
 * properties tracked their most valuable queue by scrolling, and a request
 * that went unanswered for three days looked exactly like one that never
 * arrived.
 *
 * It is therefore the FIRST thing on this screen, above the numbers, and it
 * only appears when there is something waiting. A section that renders an
 * empty state above the figures every day would train an agent to scroll past
 * the one place that costs them money.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * REFERENCE 7033: THE FIGURE HERO AND THE NEXT ACTION (Session 3, 6 October)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The band leads with "Needs you today": open inspection requests plus unread
 * messages, the two queue tiles beneath it, and only the ones that were read.
 * An inspections read that failed used to draw its tile as 0; it is now left
 * out of the tiles and the figure, the rule the host home already kept. The
 * oldest request still waiting on the agent (REQUESTED, the ball in their
 * court) is promoted to the one next action and leaves the list below.
