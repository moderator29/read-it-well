/**
 * The wait, on the agent dashboard.
 *
 * This screen awaits the agent's profile, their listing counts, their bookings
 * and an earnings series before it renders anything: it is the heaviest read in
 * Agent Mode, and it is the landing screen after a sign-in, so it is the first
 * thing a new agent experiences.
 *
 * IT WAS RESERVING A SCREEN THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.
 *
 * `RealDashboard` was rebuilt from eleven surfaces to four. It is now a run of
 * labelled sections, each one a single grouped surface of rows: the numbers are
 * five rows, the listing breakdown is rows, the stays are rows, the quick
 * actions are rows. This file still reserved the shape it replaced, five stat
 * cards in a two/three/five column wall and two side-by-side panel cards at
 * 1.6fr / 1fr.
 *
 * So the wait drew seven bordered boxes in a grid and the screen then dissolved
 * them into four columns of rows, which is a layout shift dressed as a
 * transition and the exact fault the notifications skeleton had. The whole
 * point of reserving space is that nothing moves when the data lands; a
 * skeleton that reserves the wrong space is worse than none, because it teaches
 * the eye a shape and then corrects it.
 *
 * It reserves the real one now: a section label, then a grouped surface of
 * rows, twice, at the row heights `nf-row` actually draws.
