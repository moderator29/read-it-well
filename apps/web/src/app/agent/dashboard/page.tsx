/**
 * The agent workspace.
 *
 * A signed-in approved agent sees their own numbers, read live under RLS.
 *
 * NOBODY ELSE SEES NUMBERS AT ALL, and that is the whole of this change. This
 * screen used to fall back to a deck of invented figures for every other
 * caller: 845,060,000 kobo of earnings, 248 bookings, a 98% response rate, an
 * eighteen point sparkline, four listings called Oceanview 3BR Apartment and
 * Victoria Island Luxury Stay, and three guest messages from John D., Maryam
 * S. and Tunde A. A badge above it read "Designed figures", and the file that
 * held them had already worked out why that is not enough: it says, about the
 * agent's own name, that identity is the one thing a label cannot rescue. It
 * was right, and it applied the reasoning to the agent while leaving three
 * invented guests and their messages on the same screen.
 *
 * The catalogue of twenty-three invented listings was deleted for the same
 * reason. This was the same thing in the workspace nobody had opened yet.
 *
 * So there are three honest answers and no fourth. Signed out: this is what
 * the workspace is, here is the way in. Signed in without an agent row: you
 * have no listings yet, here is how to start. Unconfigured: say so plainly.
