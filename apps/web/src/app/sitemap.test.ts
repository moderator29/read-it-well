/**
 * THE SITEMAP HAS TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IS PUBLIC.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE, AND WHY IT IS A DIFFERENT TEST NOW
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * It used to hold a fake database against the route and check that an example
 * listing could not reach a crawler through the sitemap, which was surface one
 * of the four the syndication gate governs. That test was right and it is now
 * about nothing: the route reads no database, because after the founder's item
 * 8 there is no public inventory surface for a row to point at. The other
 * three surfaces (JSON-LD, the Open Graph card, email) still go through
 * `lib/listings/syndication.ts` and still have their own tests.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS INSTEAD, AND WHY THIS IS THE STRONGER CHECK
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * A sitemap that advertises pages a crawler is then refused at is worse than
 * no sitemap: Search Console reads every row as a redirect and the one honest
 * public surface is buried under the queue of bounces. The failure is not that
 * a bad row gets in; it is that the sitemap and the gate DISAGREE.
 *
 * So every URL the route emits is put through `isPublicPath`, which is the
 * function the running middleware itself calls. Not a copy of the list, not a
 * restatement: the live rule. The two cannot drift, in either direction,
 * without this going red and naming the path.
 *
 * `robots.txt` is held to the same answer, because it is the third statement
 * of the same decision and the one most likely to be forgotten.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WOULD REPORT ON AN EMPTY SITEMAP, asked before it was written:
 * "every URL is public" is trivially true of no URLs, so the count and the
 * landing page are checked first and the file refuses rather than passes.
