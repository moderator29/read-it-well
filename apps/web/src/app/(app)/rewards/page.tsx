/**
 * /rewards: THE REWARDS BALANCE, MEMBER SIDE (D51, Round 3 R3 C3).
 *
 * One subject, the balance, with the invite link and two inner pages (the
 * referral list, the history) and the withdraw flow behind it (D25).
 *
 * LINKED, AND HONEST ABOUT WHAT IS BEHIND THE LINK. It was kept out of member
 * navigation while the referral engine and its read did not exist (R-C3-1 to
 * Session 2), and the founder could not find it. It is a row in the member
 * navigation, the settings hub and the invite hub now (7 October 2026), and
 * until the read is live this route draws the honest not-live state and sends
 * the member to the invite link, which works today. No balance is invented.
 * The dashboard itself is built and seen with fixture data at
 * `/preview/rewards`. When the read is live and the money sentences are in
 * `lib/money/copy.ts`, this page draws it with no change here.
 *
 * PAUSED (D64): the dashboard draws the pause and offers no invite link, so
 * the member's code is not even read while the programme is paused.
