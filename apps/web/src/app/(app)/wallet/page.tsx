 * `docs/design/references/2026-10-08/WALLET-PROMPT.md`, and his governing
 * reference beside it; ADR 0003). What a member sees is money our escrow
 * partner holds for them, read from the partner with its time.
 *
 * Five honest states and no sixth: signed out; not connected (the whole
 * wallet drawn with no figure, because any figure would be invented);
 * opening the account; the read failed; and the wallet itself. Its screens:
 * /wallet/transactions, /wallet/settings, /wallet/add, /wallet/send and
 * /wallet/withdraw, each through `WalletRoute`. The preview harness draws
 * every state with sample reads (`/preview/money/wallet`).
