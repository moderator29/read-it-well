/**
 * The Stays home page, to `GOVERNING-09` SCREEN ONE.
 *
 * SAME ANATOMY AS THE PROPERTY SIDE, STAYS CONTENT, and it is literally the
 * same three components: `HomeHero`, `CategoryRow` and `FeaturedBand`. When
 * the coin flips, the whole page becomes this one, which is what the flip has
 * always promised, and it can only keep that promise if the two sides are one
 * object with two sets of words rather than two screens that look similar.
 *
 * THE GREETING AND THE LOCATION ARE KEPT, on the founder's instruction, EVEN
 * THOUGH THE RENDER DROPS THEM for a bare place chip in the corner. They are
 * the reader's own facts and they are the same facts on both sides, so a flip
 * does not change who you are or where you are.
 *
 * FIVE TILES BECAME FOUR AND THE SET CHANGED. `StayCategoryTiles` drew Hotels,
 * Apartments, Resorts, Guest Houses and Serviced, which are five property
 * TYPES. The render draws four DOORS: Hotels, Shortlets, Restaurants and
 * Nearby. A type is a filter and a door is a thing you came here to do, and
 * the render is right. The five types are still reachable, from the filter
 * sheet on `/stays/search` where every other type filter already lives.
 *
 * THE RESTAURANTS RAIL CAME OFF and Restaurants is a tile now, pointing at the
 * same `/restaurants` the rail's "See all" pointed at. Nothing became
 * unreachable; one surface stopped being drawn twice on one screen.
 *
 * The featured shelf reads BB's catalogue projection first (`stays_search`
 * through `listStaysShelf`, which carries accommodations as well as
 * listings) and falls back to the listing repository, so the shelf is never
 * empty while one read has rows and the other does not.
