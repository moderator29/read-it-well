/**
 * The two ways to pay.
 *
 * Card opens a hosted Paystack page; wallet settles inside the platform in one
 * atomic database call. Neither button prices anything: the amount comes from
 * the stored booking row and the server actions read it again for themselves, so
 * nothing a browser could edit reaches the ledger.
 *
 * One idempotency key is minted per method per mount, so the second of two taps
 * on a flaky connection replays the first answer instead of paying twice. Every
 * failure lands as one plain sentence saying what happened and what the guest
 * can do next; no code, no stack, no silence.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE THREE PENDING STATES USED TO BE A `loading` PROP ON A BUTTON.
 *
 * `card-starting`, `card-redirecting` and `wallet-paying` rendered as a
 * spinner inside a pill and nothing else. No sentence, no amount, no mark, no
 * live region. Between tapping "Pay 1,250,000 naira from my wallet" and
 * anything happening, a person moving the largest sum on this platform saw a
 * disc rotating inside the button they had just pressed, on a button that was
 * simultaneously disabled, which is how a loading state and a dead control end
 * up looking identical.
 *
 * All three are one `ResultSheet state="pending"` now, over the page, carrying
 * the three things a pending state owes somebody: a mark, the amount, and the
 * consequence. The wallet already did this properly four times over and
 * checkout did it nowhere.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * AND NEITHER PATH HAD A TIMEOUT.
 *
 * If `startCardCheckout` hung, `busy` stayed true forever, BOTH pay buttons
 * stayed disabled with no explanation, and there was no cancel. On a Lagos
 * network that is not an edge case. There is a soft message at ten seconds
 * and a terminal state at twenty-five, and both say whether the money moved.
 *
 * THE SECOND HALF OF THAT PARAGRAPH IS NOW OBSOLETE AND HAS BEEN REMOVED
 * RATHER THAN LEFT TO MISLEAD. It described `window.location.assign` being
 * slow or blocked, and `card-redirecting` spinning indefinitely behind it.
 * Neither exists: there is no navigation, and `checkout-open` hands the wait
 * to `PaystackCheckout`, which has its own clock and its own honest ending.
 * The two clocks here now cover only the server round trip, which is the only
 * thing left for them to cover.

        announces over the one the person is using. What is underneath is our
        page, and the address bar has never stopped being ours.
