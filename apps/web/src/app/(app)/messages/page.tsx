/**
 * The Inbox: every conversation the reader is part of.
 *
 * It was called Messages, and it was a header with a flat list under it. The
 * word and the shape both changed: an inbox is a place you work through, so it
 * has a search field, a way to hold people you have never spoken to apart from
 * people you have, a compose button, and one act that clears the lot.
 *
 * Signed in on a configured platform the rows are real conversations under RLS
 * with real unread state. Signed out there is nothing, and this now says so.
 *
 * **It used to show a stranger somebody else's inbox.** Falling through to
 * `getMessageRepository()` served three invented conversations with named
 * agents about real listings, through this exact component, with no label
 * anywhere on the page. The agent repository had already decided the principle
 * when it deleted its own seeded agent, back in August: identity is the one
 * thing a "designed figures" label cannot rescue. That file is itself gone now,
 * which is why this says what it decided rather than where to read it. So the fixture is deleted rather than
 * labelled, and what a signed-out reader gets is the truth plus the two ways
 * in.
 *
 * An empty inbox with a search field and two tabs would be a worse answer than
 * this panel. There is nothing to search and no request to sort, and offering
 * the controls of a thing somebody does not have is its own small lie.
