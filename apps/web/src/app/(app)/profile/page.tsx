 * a bordered strip and seven square tiles. They were not two designs of one
 * screen, they were two people, and only one of them looked like it belonged to
 * this platform.
 *
 * It is built to `50E032EA` now, on this surface's own classes (`profile.css`,
 * `nf-pf-*`): the cover, the round face on its lit ring, the counts, the
 * Belongings and Posts control, the four belongings rows and Switch role.
 * Every figure on it is read from the database; the whole chain is written
 * out in `docs/archive/BUILD_SESSION_B_LEDGER.md`, section 1.
 *
 * **The cover, the counts and the posts all need a claimed handle**, because
 * they all live on `social_profiles`. Somebody who has not claimed one is not
 * shown empty versions of them. They get the same header without the counts,
 * and an offer, because the fastest way to get somebody their own page is to
 * show them the one that is waiting.
 *
 * Signed out, or before the platform keys land, the same header shape stands
 * with only what is actually known on it. It used to show 8 trips, 23 saved
 * and 5 reviews to somebody who had never booked anything, because those three
 * numbers were constants in the file. See `SignedOutHero`.
