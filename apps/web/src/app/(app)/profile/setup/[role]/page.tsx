/**
 * SETTING UP A PROFILE YOU SWITCHED INTO.
 *
 * This is where "Become an agent" went, and the move is the point rather than
 * a tidy-up. There is no longer a marketing destination called Become an Agent
 * with a hero, six step cards, an earnings tease and two call-to-action
 * buttons. There is one account with three profiles on it, a sheet that
 * switches between them, and this: the form that finishes a profile the person
 * has already chosen from that sheet.
 *
 * WHY THE ROLE IS IN THE PATH. `/agents/apply` asked, on its first step, which
 * kind of agent you are - the same question the sheet asks, one screen
 * earlier, with a better explanation attached. Two asks, one answer, and
 * nothing reconciling them. The segment carries the answer forward, the wizard
 * locks its type field to it, and the question is asked exactly once.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES UNDER /profile. Because that is what it is. Switching profile
 * is a profile action, setting one up is the same action taking longer, and a
 * person who abandons this halfway should land back on the screen they started
 * from rather than on a marketing page in the public site chrome.
 *
 * ONE SEGMENT NOW, AND IT USED TO BE TWO. `owner` has its own route beside
 * this one, `profile/setup/owner`, which draws `GOVERNING-03`: four screens,
 * the honest answer on the ownership question, and a form a landlord can
 * finish. A static segment wins over a dynamic sibling in Next's router, so
 * that page serves the owner and nothing here has to know about it; the value
 * is dropped from this list so that a reader of this file is not told there is
 * an owner form here when there is not.
 *
 * `renter` was never one of them: there is no application to be a renter and
 * there never will be (see roles.ts), so it 404s here rather than rendering an
 * empty form.
