/**
 * A legal document, read from inside the product: a designed reading
 * surface rather than a card of paragraphs.
 *
 * The same text as the marketing page and a different frame, which is the
 * whole point. Tapping Privacy in the side navigation used to hand a
 * signed-in person to `(site)/privacy`: a different shell, a different
 * header, and no way back into the product except the browser's own back
 * button. So the document comes to them. `PageHeader` carries the platform
 * back flow already, so a person reading the refund rules from a checkout
 * screen lands back on that checkout screen.
 *
 * THE ANATOMY. The header with its back control stays the product's own,
 * on the member's theme. Everything that is the document is on PAPER, the
 * shared `DocumentSheet` the public `/terms`, `/privacy` and `/disclaimer`
 * already use (R3-03): one release, one material for one legal text, and the
 * sheet prints on its own. On the paper: the last-updated line, the contents
 * as a numbered index (every section a 44px row, anchored to the section),
 * then the sections as measured prose with hairlines between them and a
 * quiet way back to the contents under each. The way out (the sibling
 * document and support) is product chrome again, under the sheet.
 *
 * The content itself lives in `lib/legal/`, imported by both routes, because
 * a legal text that says two different things in two places is not a legal
 * text. The registered name of the operator appears only inside that text,
 * where the document is legal text (rule 14); everything this frame draws
 * says Vallo.
