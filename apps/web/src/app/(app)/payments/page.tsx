 * /payments: what a renter or guest has paid through Vallo, and every refund

 *
 * A RECORD, NOT AN ACCOUNT. Vallo never holds anybody's money: when somebody
 * pays, Paystack splits the charge in the same transaction: the lister's share
 * to the lister's bank and any platform fee to Vallo. So there is
 * nothing on this screen to top up, spend or withdraw, and the figure at the
 * top is the sum of what was paid, said as that. Every row is read from
 * `my_payments_history` under the person's own session, at the moment of
 * asking (lib/money/history.ts).
 *
 * The total is lifetime and does not change as "Show earlier" pages back; the
 * list is fifty rows at a time, newest first, grouped by Lagos day.
