/**
 * NOTHING UNDER THIS LAYOUT IS FOR A CRAWLER, AND THE TAG NOW SAYS SO.
 *
 * The root layout used to declare `robots: { index: true, follow: true }`
 * (UI-16 removed it: no tag is the indexable default, and stating it put
 * "index, follow" beside a not-found page's "noindex"). That was right when
 * browsing was open: `/search`, `/listing/[id]`, `/around`,
 * `/stays` and `/stay/[id]` were the inventory we wanted found. The founder's
 * item 8 of 23 September closed all of them, and roughly half the routes under
 * this group had no robots directive of their own, so they went on inheriting
 * an invitation to index a page the gate would refuse.
 *
 * No crawler can act on that, because `proxy.ts` answers a signed-out request
 * with a 307 to `/sign-in` and the HTML is never served. It is fixed here
 * anyway, for two reasons. A tag that contradicts the gate is a tag the next
 * person reads and believes. And the day one of these routes is deliberately
 * reopened, the safe default is the one that has to be switched ON rather than
 * the one somebody has to remember to switch off.
 *
 * ONE PLACE RATHER THAN THIRTY. Next merges metadata down the tree, so a page
 * that states its own `robots` still wins: the pages that already carry
 * `index: false` are unaffected, and any page deliberately reopened states it
 * here. The public site (landing, company and legal pages) carries no tag and
 * is indexed by default, as it must be.

 * The consumer layout, for both sides.

 * without changing any URL. Locale and dictionary are resolved once here and
 * handed down; the active destination is worked out inside the shell from the
 * current path.
 *
 * The shell is a client component, so the two facts it cannot fetch itself, who
 * is signed in and how many notifications they have not read, are resolved here
 * on the server and passed down. The name used to be a hardcoded "Guest" whose
 * own comment said "until real sessions land", which stopped being true the day
 * auth shipped, so every signed-in user was greeted by the placeholder.
