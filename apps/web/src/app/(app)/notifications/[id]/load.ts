/**
 * ONE NOTIFICATION AND WHAT CAME BEFORE IT ON THE SAME RECORD.
 *
 * Both reads run under the caller's own RLS (`notifications_select_own`: a
 * person reads their own rows and nobody else's, admins included), so a link
 * to somebody else's notification resolves to "missing", which is the truth
 * from this reader's side and leaks nothing about whether the row exists.
 *
 * THE TIMELINE IS THE REAL ROWS, NOT A RECONSTRUCTION. It is every one of this
 * person's notifications whose link names the same record (same path, query
 * ignored), oldest first, bounded. A notification with no record link (a
 * general page such as /settings) has no timeline, and says so. When the table
 * gains an object id (request W5-2) this becomes an equality on that column.
