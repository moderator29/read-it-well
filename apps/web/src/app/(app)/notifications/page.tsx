 * Notifications.

 * RLS, day-grouped, with realtime arrivals and read state persisted through the
 * read_at column grant.
 *
 * The other two states used to render a hardcoded list of five invented
 * notifications, unlabelled, to anyone at all: a visitor who had never booked
 * anything was told "Booking confirmed, Lekki Palm Grove Shortlet is locked in"
 * and "Your wallet is ready". That is the exact thing owner rules 13 and 22
 * forbid, on a surface whose entire value is that it can be believed. Both are
 * now honest, designed screens with a way onward.
 *
 * Deleting the seeded list also removed the "Offers" filter chip, which no
 * notification kind could ever match (docs/DEAD_ENDS.md M3, first half).
