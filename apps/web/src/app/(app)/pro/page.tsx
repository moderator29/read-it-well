/**
 * /pro: THE PLANS, WHAT EACH INCLUDES, AND WHERE THE MEMBER STANDS (P6,
 * 7 October 2026; D83, the founder's rulings of 8 October).
 *
 * THE HONEST STATE. The plans are rows: Vallo Pro and Vallo Business, each
 * with its monthly price, its promotion quotas and what else it includes, and
 * the free trial's length as one settings value. The page reads them for
 * everybody (the plan tables are public), so a visitor sees the same prices a
 * member does. A read that fails shows no plan at all rather than a
 * remembered figure.
 *
 * PAYING IS OPEN behind `subscriptions_checkout` (a missing row reads off): a
 * signed-in member can start the free trial (no card, once ever) or subscribe
 * through Paystack, and a member holding a plan through a subscription sees
 * its status, the trial's end or the next charge, and can cancel. The member's
 * own `member_subscriptions` rows are read here under RLS; a failed read
 * offers nothing rather than a trial they may already have had. Paying also
 * needs Paystack configured, not switched off, and the service role (the
 * checkout is opened with it).
 *
 * THE SWITCH IS NOT HERE. A.11: the Pro switch exists only for somebody who
 * has paid, and it lives in the workspace it deepens (`ProSwitch` in the agent
 * and host shells). A member who holds a plan is told where the switch is,
 * never shown a second one.
