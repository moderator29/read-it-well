 * A crypto payment, before its row is read (W2, round 5): the page itself,
 * inert (`MoneyWait`). The header, the progress card and the custody note
 * are drawn where the page draws them; the state and its sentence (three
 * lines, the length of the waiting and confirming sentences at phone width),
 * and the four steps' words, are slabs. The steps are not named in the wait on
 * purpose: four numbered steps with none lit would read as nothing done,
 * and a step is only ever shown as done when it is (MOTION_SYSTEM, money).
 * The provider's name is a server fact, so the note under it is the page's
 * own sentence.
