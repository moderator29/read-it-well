        THE ANCHORED FOOT IS BACK, AND THE TWO FAULTS THAT TOOK IT AWAY ARE NOT.

        An audit removed an earlier foot because it painted over the amenity
        tiles at 390 and quoted a total a second time under a card that
        already stated it. The premium standard (7 October) asks for one
        detail anatomy across both markets and one anchored primary action,
        and the Property side ends on `ListingStickyBar`. So: the foot ships
        its own measured spacer (nothing is painted under it), and it is now
        the page's ONLY Book now: the dates card submits as a secondary and
        no longer carries a total or a Book now of its own. An example stay
        books nothing, so it draws no foot.
