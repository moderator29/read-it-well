 * the screen was built and tested against. The two are deliberately different
 * and this function is the only place they meet, so neither side has to learn
 * the other's vocabulary and a column rename cannot reach the markup.
 *
 * Null means no accommodation row exists for this id, which is the honest
 * answer while hosts are still onboarding: the route then delegates to the
 * catalogue listing rather than drawing an error, so the two URLs never drift.
