/**
 * Saved searches.
 *
 * The hunts this account keeps, read under its own policy in this request, so
 * what is drawn is what the database holds and a reload proves it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE EMPTY STATE IS THE MAIN STATE, AND IT IS WRITTEN AS ONE.
 *
 * A new account has no saved searches BY DEFINITION, so this screen's first
 * and most-seen face is the one with nothing on it. It does not apologise, it
 * does not describe a feature in the abstract, and it does not say "tap the
 * bookmark" about a control the reader cannot see from here. It says what a
 * saved search is FOR, in one sentence, and sends them to the one place the
 * control exists.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FOUR STATES, ALL DESIGNED. A read that failed is NOT drawn as an empty
 * shortlist: telling somebody their saved work is gone when the query simply
 * did not come back is the worst thing this screen could do, so a failed read
 * gets the unreachable screen, which says the fault is ours and nothing was
 * lost. Signed out gets its own screen rather than a redirect, because the
 * product shell may or may not have caught them first.
