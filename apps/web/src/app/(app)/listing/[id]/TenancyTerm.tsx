/**
 * How long a tenancy, and what that comes to.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND FIRMLY WHAT IT IS NOT.
 *
 * Nigerian rent is paid in whole terms up front, and one year is a floor rather
 * than a default: a landlord asking for two years at signing is ordinary. The
 * panel around this quoted one year and stopped, so somebody being asked for
 * two had to do the multiplication in their head on the way to the message.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT BOOK, HOLD, RESERVE OR CHARGE ANYTHING. `RentalPanel` carries no
 * Reserve control on purpose - the rental path is message the agent, inspect
 * the property, then pay - and this control does not open a second one. It
 * changes a number on a card. The only thing to press on this panel is still
 * "Message agent".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE CAPTION IS NOT DECORATION.
 *
 * Multiplying the rent by the term states a total, and a total on a screen
 * reads as a price somebody has agreed to. Nobody has. Rent is negotiated, a
 * second year is often not simply twice the first, and the fees around it -
 * caution, agency, legal - are a separate conversation this figure does not
 * include. So the caption says what the number is: the rent alone, for that
 * many terms, before anybody has agreed anything.
 *
 * That is the difference between a helpful sum and an invented quote.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
