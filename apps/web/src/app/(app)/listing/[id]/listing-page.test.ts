/**
 * THE LISTING PAGE, TO THE FOUNDER'S REFERENCE (13 October 2026), held where
 * a screen cannot be mounted under the unit config: the page is a server
 * component that reads a database, so its wiring is read as source, as the
 * other listing tests here do.
 *
 *   - A home to rent or to buy has "Schedule a visit", linking to the viewing
 *     flow at /listing/[id]/visit, on the pinned foot (full width on a phone)
 *     and on the desktop summary card. A stay keeps Check availability and its
 *     reserve panel; an example keeps its honest way out.
 *   - Nothing that was on the page left it: every panel and tool is still
 *     mounted.
 *   - The rating is drawn only with real reviews behind it, counted with
 *     countOf; the lister card reads published rows.
