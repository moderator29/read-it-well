 * profile, and the chip beside it goes to the screen that changes it. The
 * cards are the catalogue's real rows and the places are `public.areas`.
 *
 * This file owns the reads and the gate; `HomeScreen` owns the screen, so the
 * preview harness can render the same screen from fixtures.
 *
 * Rendered per request rather than cached, because a page that says "Good
 * morning" cannot be served from a build that ran last night.
