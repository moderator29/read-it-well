/**
 * Notifications, channel by channel, and the phones they reach.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * TWO THINGS ARE MOUNTED HERE THAT WERE NOT BEFORE, AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE
 * THAT MATTERS.
 *
 * `PushSetting` is the one place asking about notifications is not an
 * interruption, because the person came here to ask us.
 *
 * `PushDevices` is what makes the permission reversible. WITHOUT A DEVICE
 * LIST, PUSH IS SOMETHING A PERSON CAN GRANT AND CANNOT TAKE BACK except by
 * uninstalling Vallo, which is not a setting, it is an ultimatum.
 *
 * Both are below the existing channel toggles rather than above them. The
 * toggles are what a person came for; the devices are the fine print of a
 * decision they have already made.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE ROWS ARE FORMATTED HERE, IN THE SERVER COMPONENT.
 *
 * The client component holds no copy of the device data, so there is no path
 * by which the screen shows a device that is no longer live: the actions call
 * `revalidatePath` and this re-renders from the database. Nothing that leaves
 * this file carries a push token. See `lib/push/devices.ts` for what is
 * selected and, more to the point, what is not.
 *
 * SIGNED OUT, THE PUSH BLOCK IS NOT DRAWN AT ALL. A device list belongs to an
 * account, and a stranger on a shared handset has no account here yet. The
 * channel toggles above still work: they fall back to the device document,
 * which is the existing behaviour and is not changed.
