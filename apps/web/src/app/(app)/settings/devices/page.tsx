 *
 * ## What is on this screen, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * Each row carries when the session began, when it was last used, and the
 * device where we honestly have one. There is NO location, not even an
 * approximate one, and its absence is the considered answer rather than a gap:
 * `auth.sessions.ip` records whoever last refreshed the token, the refresh runs
 * in our own middleware, so the address on the row is a data centre's. A city
 * drawn from that would be a confident lie in the one place a person is making
 * a security decision. `lib/security/sessions.ts` carries the full reasoning
 * and `my_sessions()` does not return the column at all.
 *
 * The formatting all happens here rather than in the client component below.
 * The actions call `revalidatePath` and this re-renders, so the list is server
 * truth after every button; a client component holding its own copy of the
 * sessions would be one stale render away from telling somebody a device they
 * just ended is still signed in.
