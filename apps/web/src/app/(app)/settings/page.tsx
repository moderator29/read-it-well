 * methods block, Log Out. It used to be every preference on one screen, four
 * thousand pixels of it; the preferences are all still here, one tap down,
 * grouped under the row that names them: `/settings/account`,
 * `/settings/notifications`, `/settings/privacy`, `/settings/appearance` and
 * `/settings/help`.
 *
 * The search field that sat under the headline is gone from this screen: the
 * render has none, and six rows do not need one. The account screen keeps
 * its search over the preferences it holds (`./account`).
 *
 * Two worlds, one screen. Signed in on a configured platform the hub's switch
 * writes `profiles.settings` under row level security; signed out, or before
 * the platform keys land, it writes the device document, exactly as before.
