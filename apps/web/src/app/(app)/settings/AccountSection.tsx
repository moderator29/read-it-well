/**
 * The account block: who you are signed in as, sign out, and deletion.
 *
 * DELETION MOVED OUT OF THIS FILE. It used to be a drawer here that ended in
 * `admin.auth.admin.deleteUser`, which cannot complete for anybody who has
 * booked or paid for anything, because `bookings.guest_id` and
 * `wallets.user_id` are both `on delete restrict`. The whole flow, its
 * preconditions and the thirty day window now live in `DeleteAccountPanel`,
 * driven by `lib/account-deletion`. See `docs/design/audits/r3/findings.md`
 * F-17.
 *
 * The control stays exactly where it was, last in the Account group, reading
 * as what it is before it is pressed. It is not hidden, not moved behind a
 * support link and not made harder to find than it was: rule 15 is as binding
 * on a control somebody is leaving through as on one they are arriving at.
