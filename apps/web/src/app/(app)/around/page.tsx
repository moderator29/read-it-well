/**
 * Around: the feed, to `GOVERNING-feed-plus-bloom.png`.
 *
 * Top to bottom: the location chip (the person's own place, the chevron
 * opening the real choices), the story rings, the For you / Following capsule,
 * the cards, and the plus that blooms. The app's own header sits above all of
 * it and the dock below; both are the shell's.
 *
 * Three timelines, and each one is honest about what it is:
 *
 *   For you    your places and everything said to the platform at large. A
 *              first visit must never be an empty screen, so somebody who has
 *              joined nothing gets everywhere rather than nothing.
 *   Following  ONLY your places, plus the public posts, because a public post
 *              is addressed to everybody and that includes you. It says
 *              nothing when you have joined nothing, because pretending
 *              otherwise would make the two segments the same segment.
 *   One place  chosen from the chip: that place's own timeline, the same read
 *              `/around/[slug]` makes. It lives in `?place=` so a reload lands
 *              where the person was.
 *
 * Unconfigured is not signed out. Signed out is a person we know nothing
 * about; unconfigured is a platform that cannot look anybody up, and only one
 * of them is fixed by signing in. Without keys the page reads nothing, so it
 * says nothing about the country, and the bloom stays away because there is
 * nothing behind it.
