/**
 * `/price/area/[id]`. WHERE A SHARE CARD LANDS.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DESTINATION IS THE HALF OF A SHARE THAT USUALLY GETS SKIPPED.
 *
 * Stage one shipped a share enum, a share table, a check constraint and a
 * server action with nowhere for a card to go. A link with no destination is
 * not a share, and a card that cannot be opened cannot be checked by anybody
 * against the rule it is supposed to obey.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS ON THIS PAGE, AND WHAT CANNOT BE.
 *
 * An area, a type, a bedroom count, a range and the count the range came from.
 * NO ADDRESS, and not because this page politely declines to print one: the
 * row it reads has no address, latitude, longitude or listing id column, the
 * scope enum has no label for a property, and a check constraint refuses an
 * area string shaped like a street address. There is nothing here to print.
 *
 * THE FIGURES ARE FROZEN AND THE PAGE SAYS SO. A card that silently
 * recalculated would be a record of nothing, which is the same reasoning saved
 * checks are frozen under. It carries the month it was made, so a reader who
 * meets it a year from now can see how old it is rather than trusting a number
 * with no date on it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A STRANGER ARRIVES HERE AND `/price` IS OPEN TO THEM.
 *
 * `price` is deliberately not in `proxy.ts`'s `PRODUCT_SEGMENTS`, which
 * `lib/price-check/route-openness.test.ts` holds in place with the reasoning,
 * and this route inherits that because the proxy decides on the FIRST path
 * segment. A forwarded card that bounced its reader to a sign-in wall would be
 * the one thing worse than a card nobody can open.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DISCLAIMER TRAVELS WITH THE FIGURE.
 *
 * Rule 3 of `PRICE_CHECK_DISCLAIMER`: it goes with any figure that leaves the
 * product, and a share card is the definition of a figure that has left. The
 * reader of this page may never have seen `/price` at all, so the page does
 * not assume they have read anything.
 */

/**
 * THE TITLE AND THE CARD ARE A READ, NEVER A GUESS.
 *
 * `/price` declares STATIC metadata and says why: a title built from a query
 * string would put somebody's own neighbourhood into a page title and into
 * whatever crawls it, and a machine-readable tag is a claim the product has to
 * be able to stand behind. This route is the other case. What it names is a
 * STORED ROW that somebody deliberately published, and every word of it is
 * already on the page, so reading it is neither a guess nor a disclosure.
 *
 * A row that cannot be read gets a title and NO OPEN GRAPH BLOCK at all.
 * `opengraph-image.tsx` refuses in the same breath, so nothing unfurls a card
 * that does not exist.
 *
 * `metadata` and `generateMetadata` may not both be exported from one route,
 * which is why the static one is gone rather than kept as a fallback.
