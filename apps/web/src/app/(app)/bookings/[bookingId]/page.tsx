/**
 * ONE BOOKING, AND THE ROUTE THAT DID NOT EXIST.
 *
 * R2 finding R2-2, confirmed critical: `components/app/messages/share.ts`
 * builds `/bookings/<id>` for a booking shared into a chat, and its own
 * comment called that "the trips hub's own detail route". There was no such
 * route. `app/(app)/bookings/` held `page.tsx` and `[bookingId]/review` and
 * nothing else, so TWO primary buttons (the booking card in a thread and the
 * thread's own context banner) ended the reservations-and-threads journey on
 * a 404, at the last tap, on the screen where somebody is checking a stay
 * they have paid for.
 *
 * It is built rather than repointed at the list. A shared card promises to
 * open the booking it shows, and a list is not that: on an account with nine
 * stays it asks the reader to find the one they were just sent.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE READ, AND WHY IT IS `getMyBookings`.
 *
 * This link travels in a chat, so it reaches people who are not party to the
 * booking. `getMyBookings` reads `bookings` through the SIGNED-IN READER'S own
 * RLS-bound client, which is the only thing standing between a stranger and
 * somebody else's stay, and it is deliberately the only thing: a second
 * ownership check in this file would be a second place for the rule to live
 * and the weaker of two rules is the one that ends up enforced.
 *
 * Asking it for the whole account and picking one row costs one extra read on
 * a detail page and buys the thing that matters: `cancellable`, `reviewable`,
 * `payable` and the tenancy branch are computed in ONE place, so this page and
 * the hub can never disagree about whether a stay can still be called off.
 *
 * NOT YOURS AND NOT THERE LAND ON THE SAME PANEL, deliberately. Telling them
 * apart would confirm to somebody guessing ids that a booking exists, and the
 * two are indistinguishable to this reader anyway: neither is theirs.
 *
 * A TENANCY IS NOT A STAY HERE EITHER. A rent charge shares the bookings
 * table, so a shared link can resolve to one; it is drawn by `TenancyCard`,
 * with a move-in day and a period, and never with nights and guests.
