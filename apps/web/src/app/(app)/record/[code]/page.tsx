 * it into search lands here and sees the live Record, not a screenshot of one.
 *
 * States: a code that cannot be one of ours or matches nobody (one answer,
 * so the page never confirms which codes exist), too many lookups this hour,
 * a failed read, a lister with nothing counted yet, and the Record. Loading
 * is `loading.tsx` beside this file. Signed out never reaches this route: it
