/**
 * Personal Mode's error boundary: the brand moment, inside the chrome.
 *
 * This boundary sits inside the `(app)` layout, so the header and the dock
 * stay put and only the content area is replaced: a wallet read that timed
 * out must not look identical to the entire product falling over, and the
 * reader keeps every way onward. Inside that area the moment is the same
 * object as the root boundary's, the plate, the glass card with its lit rim,
 * the podium, with the tile alone for the brand because the header above
 * already carries the wordmark.
 *
 * The recovery is `reset()`, which re-runs the failed segment in place. For
 * a dropped connection, the common case here, that is genuinely all it
 * takes.
 *
 * The raw error never reaches the screen. `error.message` on a server
 * component failure is either a stack-shaped string that means nothing to
 * a guest or a detail about the database that should not be published. The
 * digest is shown instead: it is the id that finds the matching server log,
 * which is the entire reason Next generates one.
