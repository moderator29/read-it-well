/**
 * Get started: the first thing a person sees.
 *
 * What opens on a first launch from the stores, the first time somebody taps
 * Get started on the landing page, and what a stranger meets the first time
 * they press Sign up or Sign in. ONCE: a device or an account that has seen
 * it goes straight on (the founder, 29 September; `planFirstRun`). Four slides on one stage (the two
 * sides and the coin, what verified means, talk first and pay on Vallo, and
 * the ending), skippable. A stranger ends on Create account and Sign in;
 * somebody signed in ends on one Continue into the app. Governing image:
 * `2A49E2F7` in docs/design/references/.
 *
 * REACHABLE SIGNED OUT. `planFirstRun` in `./plan.ts` (a pure function with
 * its own test) chooses between skipping and which ending to show.
 *
 * THE ONE ONBOARDING (the founder, 7 October 2026: "I'm seeing 2 different
 * types... Keep THESE ones"). Every stranger meets the same four slides
 * (`FirstRun`), from slide one, whatever way they came in: Get started, the
 * first Sign in or Sign up on a device (the doors send them here once,
 * `app/(auth)/sign-in/first-run-gate.ts`), the app's first open (`/open`) or an
 * invite link (`/join/<code>`). The end, or Skip, hands them to the page they
 * asked for. The four-card intro that used to open a cold start
 * (`WelcomeIntro`, `get-started.css`) is retired, and so is the jump straight
 * to the account choice for an arrival with a destination (V-18): the last
 * slide still names where they were going.
 *
 * A device that has seen it and is going nowhere (the app reopened signed
 * out) opens on the account choice alone.
 *
 * Rendered outside the app shell on purpose: a dock underneath would offer six
 * more ways out of a screen that has exactly the ones it names.
