/**
 * The offline fallback: one calm card (`OfflineScreen`, `offline.css`).
 *
 * Precached by `public/sw.js` at install and served ONLY when a navigation
 * cannot reach the network AND this phone has no kept copy of that page
 * (every page a member has opened opens again from the phone instead). Two
 * constraints shape it:
 *
 *   1. It must render with no network at all, so it uses no optimised
 *      `next/image` URL and no data source: the mark is the precached brand
 *      file and the ground is two gradients.
 *   2. The copy has to be honest. It says this page has not been opened here
 *      yet, and that the pages that have been still open, which is what
 *      the worker does. "Go to Home" is a full load, so the worker answers it
 *      from the phone.
