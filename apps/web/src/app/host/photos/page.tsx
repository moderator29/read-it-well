/**
 * /host/photos: where an owner's own photographs go up.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A ROUTE OF ITS OWN RATHER THAN A STEP IN THE WIZARD. The wizard
 * is an application, and an application closes when it is sent: every write
 * behind it runs through `editableBusiness`, which refuses once a business is
 * SUBMITTED. Photographs are not an answer on a form, they are the venue's
 * content, and the onboarding script promises an owner they can go live the
 * day they sign and send their pictures during the week. A photograph surface
 * that shut the moment the application was sent would be shut for the entire
 * period the photographs actually arrive in.
 *
 * So the write path is `addBusinessPhoto`, which gates on ownership at any
 * status rather than on editability, and this screen is reachable from the
 * host's own standing page for every venue on the account.
 *
 * AND IT NOW SERVES BOTH SPINES, which is the whole reason a hotel could not
 * go live. A restaurant's photographs hang on its `businesses` row; a hotel's
 * or a shortlet's hang on the `accommodations` row under it, in
 * `accommodation_photos`, which had a table, a bucket, four storage policies
 * and a catalogue trigger and no writer anywhere in the application. The
 * submission gate refuses an accommodation with no photograph, so every hotel
 * and every shortlet stopped dead at the review step. One door, two spines,
 * decided by which table the chosen business's photographs actually live in,
 * because a second route would have been a second place for the cover rule to
 * drift.
