/**
 * /host/reviews (C4, 30 September 2026): what guests wrote about the host's
 * hotels, the host's one public answer to each, and a fair way to ask Vallo
 * to look at one. The agent workspace has had its reviews page for months;
 * the host workspace had none, and a hotel stay could not be reviewed at all
 * until the pending C4 migration.
 *
 * THE RATING IS THE VISIBLE REVIEWS' AVERAGE, and it is shown only once there
 * are five or more, because an average of two is a mood, not a signal. A
 * review staff hid does not count, which is the founder's recommended default
 * and what the catalogue now does too.
