/**
 * /host/rooms: how far ahead a hotel is bookable, and by how many rooms.
 *
 * THE QUESTION THIS SURFACE ANSWERS COULD NOT BE ASKED BEFORE IT.
 * `room_inventory` is one row per room type per night, and `stays_search`
 * treats a missing row as NOT OFFERED rather than as available, deliberately.
 * The table was created in M5 with its oversell lock, its two triggers and its
 * RLS, and no application file ever wrote to it or read from it: the only two
 * mentions in `apps/web/src` were comments. So every hotel on the platform was
 * invisible to every search that carried dates, and no host had any way to see
 * that, let alone change it.
 *
 * WHAT IS HONEST HERE. The night count is counted from the rows, never
 * inferred from the horizon constant: what the screen prints is what the table
 * holds. A room type with no rate plan is drawn as not on sale with the reason,
 * because the publish gate will not put it on the shelf and a host should learn
 * that here rather than from a reviewer. And the status of a room type is
 * shown as it is: DRAFT until the property is published, which is the reviewer's
 * act and not the host's.
