/**
 * /host/reservations: where a venue answers a table.
 *
 * THIS ROUTE WAS PROMISED BY THE DATABASE AND DID NOT EXIST.
 * `private.notify_reservation` has sent a business host here since M7, and the
 * only board that could answer a table was `/agent/bookings`, behind
 * `getAgentContext`, which requires an `agents` row. A restaurant owner
 * onboarded through the host wizard has a `businesses` row and no `agents`
 * row, so they could be sent a table, be notified about it, tap the
 * notification, and land on a 404 with a guest waiting for an answer.
 *
 * The reader is `getHostReservations`, which leans on RLS alone and answers
 * for both spines, so this page never restates who owns which venue. See
 * `board.ts` for the one thing this surface adds to it and why.
