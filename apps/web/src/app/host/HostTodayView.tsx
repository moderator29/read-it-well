/**
 * THE HOST WORKSPACE HOME, DRAWN (plan item 14, spec 13, reference 38 on a
 * desk and reference 31 on a phone).
 *
 * The navy hero band opens it (the founder's widened Q2): the date, "Today",
 * the one action, and the four KPI tiles sitting on the band. Under it the
 * "Needs attention" group and the reservations gauge side by side from
 * 1024px, stacked on a phone. Every figure is one `hostToday` computed from
 * the host's own rows; a tile whose source could not be read is not drawn,
 * a gauge with nothing to count is left out, and no tile carries a delta
 * chip because no figure here has a measured previous period.
 *
 * REFERENCE 7033, FIGURE HERO PLUS LIST (Session 3, 6 October). The band now
 * leads with one figure, "Needs you today": the sum of the three queue tiles
 * that were read (requests waiting, arriving today, unread), which is
 * `hostToday().needsYou` and nothing else. Under it, the oldest thing still
 * waiting is promoted to the one next action, and it leaves the "Needs
 * attention" list so nothing is listed twice. The four tiles stay where they
 * were (the 2x2 count cards of north star 15.4, each a door into its queue),
 * and so do the list and the gauge: D28, nobody's furniture moves.
