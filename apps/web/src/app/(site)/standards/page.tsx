 * Trust and safety standards.

 * A standards page is worth exactly as much as the slowest promise on it, so
 * the response times printed here are the same three numbers the admin console
 * computes a due time from: `RESPONSE_COMMITMENTS` in `lib/trust/standards.ts`
 * is imported by both. Changing what we promise changes what staff are held to,
 * in one edit, which is the only arrangement where a published clock stays
 * honest.
 *
 * Nothing here describes a control that does not exist. The scanner, the hold,
 * the queues, the audit line and the appeal are all live today.
