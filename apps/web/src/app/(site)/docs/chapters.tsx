/**
 * The documentation, as data.
 *
 * Every chapter, every heading and every paragraph lives in these modules, so
 * the sidebar, the table of contents, the "on this page" rail, the prev and
 * next links, the help search and the pages themselves read the same list. A
 * documentation site whose navigation is written separately from its content
 * is a site that will tell somebody a chapter exists and then hand them a 404.
 *
 * THE HOUSE STYLE (13 October 2026, the docs track). One topic per chapter.
 * Headings say the task ("Book a viewing", not "Viewings, and how they
 * work"). Short plain sentences. Every chapter that describes a process ends
 * with what happens next. No internal names: no table, function, flag or
 * provider a member would not see.
 *
 * Numbers that already exist in the product are IMPORTED rather than typed
 * out. The founder's money rules are written once, in `facts.ts`.
 *
 * Nothing here describes a feature that does not exist. Every screen named is
 * a real route, and every rule stated is enforced in `apps/web/src/lib` or in
 * a migration under `supabase/migrations`. A rule decided but not yet built
 * is described as the rule, never as a screen.
 *
 * A retired chapter is removed here AND given a redirect in `next.config.ts`
 * to the closest current chapter (`docs-links.dom.test.tsx` holds both).

            Vallo is a marketplace for property, stays and restaurants in Nigeria. You can rent or
