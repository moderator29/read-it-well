/**
 * The styleguide.
 *
 * POLISH_PASS item 49. The rules on this page all existed already, spread
 * across a token sheet, a globals file and a dozen primitives, which meant the
 * only way to know what a surface looked like was to find something using it
 * and go and look at that instead. That is how a second blue gets invented: a
 * person needs a slightly raised panel, cannot see what `--nf-surface-raised`
 * actually is, and writes a hex value that looks about right.
 *
 * Every swatch below PAINTS ITS OWN TOKEN. Nothing here prints a colour from a
 * literal, so this page cannot drift from the sheet: change a token and this
 * page changes with it, and a token that is deleted shows up as a swatch that
 * stops painting rather than as a page that quietly keeps lying.
 *
 * The controls are the real primitives, imported and rendered. Not screenshots,
 * not copies. If `Button` grows a variant, it appears here the moment the union
 * below is extended, and if a variant is removed the build fails on this file,
 * which is the correct place for that to hurt.
 *
 * Noindex, because this is for the people building the platform.
