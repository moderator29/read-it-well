/**
 * The marketing site's error boundary. There was none.
 *
 * A failure on any public page fell through to the root boundary, which
 * replaces the entire document with a branded full-screen page - taking the
 * site header and footer with it. On a marketing page that is the worst
 * possible trade: those two carry every route the visitor has, and this is a
 * visitor who does not have an account and has no other way back in.
 *
 * This boundary sits inside the `(site)` layout, so the header, the navigation
 * and the footer stay exactly where they are and only the article is replaced.
 * Somebody who hits a broken help page can still reach Terms, Contact, or the
 * product.
 *
 * The digest rather than the message, for the same reason every other boundary
 * here does it: `error.message` from a server component is either meaningless
 * to a reader or says something about our database that should not be
 * published.
