 * 404: the brand moment with a way to search.
 *
 * Same anatomy as the error boundary and the offline screen (the lockup over
 * the aurora plate, the glass card on its podium), with the numeral in the
 * brand gradient, a sentence that says what happened, and a search field
 * that really searches: it is a plain GET form to `/search`, whose page
 * reads `q` and answers it, so the way out of a dead link is the product's
 * own front door rather than a decorative box.
 *
 * "Back to home" means the home the reader actually has. It pointed at `/`,
 * the landing page, which for a signed-in person is not home at all. This
 * renders on the server, so it can simply ask, and a signed-in reader is
 * offered `/home` instead. The cost is one session read on a page nobody is
 * meant to reach often, and the screen still renders in full if that read
 * comes back with nothing.

       * with this body, which three workers confirmed independently tonight
       * while the preview harness was shut. So `verify-shots.mjs` checking the
       * status code is necessary and NOT sufficient: it cannot tell this page
       * from a surface, and neither can any of its other assertions. This page
       * loads the same stylesheet and has no Reveal bands to get stuck, so it
       * passes every one of them perfectly. (It also used to set `data-theme`
       * from the same inline script as every other route; that script went with
       * light mode on 23 September 2026 and nothing about this trap changed.) Workers wrote eight PNGs of this screen and
       * nearly filed them as proof that a surface had been swept.
       *
       * One attribute settles it, and it is on the page itself rather than
       * guessed at from a class name, because a class can be renamed by
       * somebody with no idea a harness depends on it.
