/**
 * Auth shell: one full-height screen, to the Slate references of 29
 * September (`docs/design/references/2026-09-29`, 12 and 14).
 *
 * Top to bottom: the CURVED TOP BLOCK, full bleed at every width (the way
 * back in its toolbar; language lives in Settings only, the founder's rule
 * of 29 September, the wordmark in spaced
 * capitals, one line under it chosen by the screen), then the screen's own
 * content in one centred column on the page colour, and the small print at
 * the foot. Every auth screen renders inside the same shell, so sign in, sign
 * up, the code, the reset and the recovery read as the same place.
 *
 * THE 3D GLASS DOOR (the founder, 30 September, after the passcode
 * reference): a bright blue bowl in both themes with the Vallo lockup, one
 * object in a glowing ring across its curve (`AuthFocal`), glass fields and
 * a glossy blue pill; the page is warm paper in light and night in dark,
 * except the sign-up flow, which is night in both (`AuthMain`). The block and its pieces are
 * `components/auth/slate.tsx`; the whole surface is `app/css/auth.css`.
