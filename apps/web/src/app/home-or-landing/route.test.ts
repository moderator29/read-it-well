/**
 * THE DEADLINE ON THE SHELL'S COLD START, which is the one of the 3 October
 * splash fixes that no client timer can cover.
 *
 * `proxy.ts` sends every shell request for `/` straight to this route, so this
 * handler's response IS the native web view's main-frame navigation. While it
 * is unresolved no document exists, so none of the splash's own failsafes has
 * been parsed, let alone armed: the phone sits on the branded image for as long
 * as the request takes, which on 2 October was more than fifteen minutes.
 * `resolveSession()` calls GoTrue over the network with no deadline of its own,
 * so "as long as the request takes" is unbounded.
 *
 * What is gated here is that the handler ALWAYS ANSWERS: inside the deadline
 * with the real session, and on timeout with the cheap cookie guess, which is
 * safe because `proxy.ts`'s own already time-bounded gate decides on the very
 * next request who may stay. A test that only checked the happy path would pass
 * against the hanging version, so the hanging session is the main case below.
