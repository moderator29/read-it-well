/**
 * THE HANG THIS ROUTE USED TO BE ABLE TO CAUSE, FOUND FROM A REAL DEVICE
 * STUCK ON THE NATIVE SPLASH SCREEN FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES (2 October
 * 2026), on a connection good enough to run every other app on the phone.
 *
 * This route is the native shell's cold-start entry point: `proxy.ts` sends
 * every shell request for `/` straight here before anything else runs. The
 * comment at the top of this file claims "the answer depends entirely on the
 * caller's own cookies", but `resolveSession()` does not read cookies alone:
 * it calls `supabase.auth.getUser()`, a live HTTPS round trip to GoTrue, with
 * no deadline of its own. `proxy.ts`'s equivalent check already learned this
 * lesson once (`AUTH_ANSWER_TIMEOUT_MS`, OPS-05) and races it against a
 * timeout; this route, being newer and believing its own claim, never did.
 * A slow or momentarily unreachable GoTrue left this request simply never
 * resolving. The native web view's main-frame navigation then never
 * completes: no page is ever delivered, so no client script -- including the
 * splash's own failsafe timers -- ever gets the chance to run. A person on a
 * phone sees exactly what was reported: the branded splash, forever, no
 * matter how long they wait, indistinguishable from the app being broken.
 *
 * The fix races the real resolution against a deadline and falls back to a
 * cheap guess from the session cookie's bare presence, which costs nothing to
 * read. A wrong guess here is not a correctness bug: `/home` and `/welcome`
 * both pass back through `proxy.ts`'s own already time-bounded gate on the
 * very next request, which is what actually decides who may stay. This route
 * only has to stop hanging; it never had to be right on its own.

 * "Home", resolved by who is asking.
 *
 * There are two homes in this product and only one word for them. `/` is the
 * landing page, which exists to explain Vallo to somebody who has never seen
 * it. `/home` is the first screen inside the platform, which is what "home"
 * means to anybody who has signed in.
 *
 * Every dead end offered "Back to home" and half of them pointed at `/`. So a
 * signed-in person who hit a 404 was thrown out of the product and onto the
 * marketing page, which reads as being logged out. The owner put it plainly:
 * that button should never take them to the landing page.
 *
 * The 404 page can answer this for itself because it renders on the server.
 * The error boundaries cannot: an error boundary is a client component by
 * requirement, so it has no session to read and the auth cookies are httpOnly
 * by design. Rather than give the two cases different answers, or have a
 * client guess from something it should not be able to see, both ask here.
 *
 * A redirect, not a page. There is nothing to render and nothing to cache: the
 * answer depends entirely on the caller's own cookies.
