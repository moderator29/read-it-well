/**
 * THE CONTROL: THE SAME ROUTES, CARRYING A SESSION, THROUGH THE REAL GUARD.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS FILE HAD TO EXIST BEFORE THE GATE COULD BE CALLED PROVEN
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * A GATE THAT REFUSES EVERYBODY PASSES A TEST THAT ONLY CHECKS REFUSALS.
 * `tests/gate.spec.mjs` watches forty-one product routes bounce an anonymous
 * visitor to `/sign-in`, and every one of those rows is equally green over a
 * middleware that redirects the entire platform, including its owners. That
 * would be a catastrophe reported as a clean run.
 *
 * So the same list is put through `proxy()` again with a session attached, and
 * every route that bounced must now not bounce.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * IT DRIVES THE REAL MIDDLEWARE, NOT A MODEL OF IT
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * `src/proxy.test.ts` asserts `isPublicPath`, which is the DECISION. This
 * calls `proxy()` itself: the real `createServerClient`, the real cookie
 * adapter, a real `getUser()` over HTTP, the real branch, the real response.
 * The difference matters, because `isPublicPath` can be perfect while the
 * middleware never consults it, and no test of a pure function can see that.
 *
 * WHAT STANDS IN FOR SUPABASE, AND WHAT THAT COSTS. This container's egress
 * proxy answers `CONNECT <project>.supabase.co:443` with 403, so no real
 * session can be obtained here at all. A local stand-in serves the ONE
 * endpoint `proxy()` calls, `GET /auth/v1/user`, and the cookie is minted by
 * the same library the middleware reads it with, so a cookie the server would
 * silently fail to parse cannot be mistaken for a session.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A CREDENTIAL. The JWT is unsigned, the address is
 * `example.invalid`, the id is all ones, and it only satisfies a client
 * pointed at `127.0.0.1`.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT EXPLICITLY DOES NOT
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * PROVES: the guard admits a request carrying a session on every route it
 * refuses without one, answers the API routes rather than refusing them, and
 * still lets the public routes through.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROVE: that those pages RENDER for a signed-in reader. A page past
 * the middleware reads data, and past this stand-in there is no data, so a
 * data-backed screen would draw its empty or not-found state for reasons that
 * have nothing to do with the gate. That half is UNPROVEN in this container
 * and is closed by one signed-in reload of the live site. Saying so is the
 * point: presenting an unreachable claim as a green row is the fault this
 * whole file exists to avoid.
