/*
 * CONTRAST FROM THE PIXELS THAT WERE ACTUALLY PAINTED, ACROSS THE WHOLE
 * PREVIEW HARNESS, IN BOTH THEMES.
 *
 * Two earlier probes computed it from the cascade and both were wrong: one took
 * a 15%-alpha `color-mix` surface as if it were opaque, and one walked past a
 * gradient because it only ever read `background-color`. The second was caught
 * by a sanity case reading 1.09 for white on a brand button, which cannot
 * happen. Nothing derived from `getComputedStyle` is trusted here.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED ON 22 SEPTEMBER, AND WHY. The previous version of this file
 * measured FOUR named elements on ONE route. That is not a contrast check, it
 * is four assertions. So it now SWEEPS: every text-bearing leaf element on
 * every route of the preview harness, at phone width, in dark and in light,
 * measured off the pixels.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED ON 22 SEPTEMBER AT 22:30, AND IT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS FILE
 * COULD NOT BE BELIEVED.
 *
 * The sweep took ONE `page.screenshot({ fullPage: true })` per route and read
 * every element's rectangle out of that single canvas. Chromium's full-page
 * capture stops containing content somewhere past roughly 4,700 CSS pixels on
 * this box: the PNG is still full height, it is still the right width, and
 * everything below the cut is BLANK. Nothing in the old file noticed. Its only
 * guard skipped elements whose rectangle fell outside the image bounds, and a
 * blank-but-full-height PNG is inside the bounds everywhere, so every element
 * below the cut was scored against paper that was never painted. A blank box
 * reads one colour twice, which the file then filed as `painted: false` if the
 * blankness was perfect and as a REAL FAILURE the moment a single stray pixel
 * of compression noise or a sliver of genuinely captured content landed in it.
 * Of 84 sampled failures from that run, 43 did not reproduce. The headline
 * "150 below the floor, 51 dark and 99 light" was measured this way and is
 * withdrawn.
 *
 * THE REPAIR, AND IT IS THE CHEAP ONE RATHER THAN THE CLEVER ONE. Do not ask
 * the browser for an image bigger than the browser can draw. Shoot the
 * VIEWPORT, which is the one rectangle Chromium is always honest about, scroll
 * down half a screen at a time, and measure only the elements that are on
 * SCREEN at that moment. Coordinates then come from `getBoundingClientRect`
 * directly, with no scroll offset arithmetic to get wrong, and the pixels under
 * an element are by construction pixels the compositor painted this frame.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating because they are what makes the number
 * trustworthy rather than merely different:
 *
 *   1. EVERY ELEMENT IS MEASURED EXACTLY ONCE. It is tagged when it is taken,
 *      so an element visible at three scroll positions is not three findings.
 *   2. AN ELEMENT NEVER SEEN WHOLE IS REPORTED, NOT GUESSED AT. Anything taller
 *      than the step that never lands fully on screen gets its own pass with
 *      its top parked at the top of the viewport; anything still unreachable
 *      after that is counted and named in `unreached`, because "we could not
 *      look at it" is a different fact from "it passes".
 *   3. THE CAPTURE IS ITSELF CHECKED. A viewport shot whose pixels are all one
 *      colour is a blank frame, and a blank frame is refused rather than
 *      measured. That is the guard whose absence made the old number an
 *      artefact.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/probe-contrast.mjs --base http://127.0.0.1:3184
 *   node scripts/probe-contrast.mjs --base ... --routes /preview/f4/settings --themes light
 *   node scripts/probe-contrast.mjs --base ... --json
 *
 * The server must be a PRODUCTION server with `VALLO_PREVIEW_HARNESS=1`.
 * `next dev` does not hydrate reliably on this box, so no proof from it counts.
