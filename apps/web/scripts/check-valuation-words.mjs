/**
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE BUILD FAILS IF THE REGULATED WORD REACHES PRODUCT CODE.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Vallo is not a registered estate surveyor and valuer. Under the Estate
 * Surveyors and Valuers Act the offence is using any name, title, addition or
 * description IMPLYING authorisation to practise, so the offence is in the
 * implication and not in the arithmetic. Price Check reports what places near
 * here are ASKING, and the regulated nouns appear in exactly one place: the
 * sentence that disclaims them, in `src/lib/price-check/disclaimer.ts`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS TO STOP, stated as the thing that would actually happen.
 * The tree already sits at that line, by accident rather than by enforcement:
 * two occurrences in `lib/legal/terms.tsx`, both inside sentences saying a
 * Vallo inspection is not one, and one occupation label naming the profession.
 * Nothing holds it there. One future commit writing "Property valuation" into
 * a page title, a push notification, a route segment or an app store listing
 * would be the regulated act, would pass every other check in this repository,
 * and would read as a nice piece of copy in review.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT AN ESLINT RULE, which is the obvious question.
 *
 * Three reasons and the third is decisive.
 *
 * ESLINT DOES NOT SEE EVERYTHING. The word must not appear in a ROUTE SEGMENT,
 * which is a directory name, and no linter walks directory names. It must not
 * appear in a manifest, a stylesheet class or a locale file outside the app.
 *
 * THE BUDGET IS WHOLE-TREE. "This file may carry three and no more" cannot be
 * answered from inside the file, and a rule that reads the rest of the tree at
 * module load is a rule whose result depends on state it did not declare.
 *
 * AND THE FLOOR IS THE POINT. The most valuable assertion here is not that the
 * word is absent. It is that the DISCLAIMER STILL SAYS IT. Every absence check
 * in this file is satisfied at once by a scan that walks nothing: a broken
 * glob, a renamed directory, an extension dropped from the list, and the gate
 * reports clean in a voice of total confidence. A lint rule has no way to
 * notice that it was never run over the file that mattered. This one does.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IT RESTATES THE RULES RATHER THAN IMPORTING THEM, ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * `src/lib/price-check/regulated-words.ts` holds the same rules in TypeScript.
 * This file is plain JavaScript and imports nothing from it, for the reason
 * `scripts/check-deep-links.mjs` gives for the same split: a build gate that
 * needs a compile step is a build gate that gets taken out of the build the
 * first morning it is in the way.
 *
 * A HAND COPY OF A RULE IS THE THING THAT DRIFTS, so
 * `src/lib/price-check/regulated-words.test.ts` RUNS this gate, over fixture
 * trees it builds itself and over the real tree, and asserts that this file's
 * verdict and the TypeScript checker's verdict agree problem for problem. It
 * does not assert that this file contains a particular string: a string in a
 * file is not a verdict, and that exact assertion is what let the deep-link
 * gate drift before it was rewritten.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * USAGE
 *
 *   node scripts/check-valuation-words.mjs
 *       Walks the repository. Word budget, disclaimer floor and scan coverage.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-valuation-words.mjs --root <dir>
 *       Walks <dir> instead, applying the word budget ONLY. A fixture tree has
 *       no disclaimer file and no thousand files in it, so running the two
 *       floors over one would fail it for reasons that are not about the
 *       fixture. The TypeScript checker carries the same distinction under the
 *       same name, `wholeTree`.
 *
 * Exit 0 clean, exit 1 with every problem named and its line given.
