 * ===========================================================================
 * THE SILENT FAULT FAMILY, AND WHY FIVE CHECKS LIVE IN ONE SCRIPT.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * This file exists because of one shape of bug, and the shape is worth naming
 * before the checks are read, because it is the only reason any of them are
 * here and it will outlive all of them.
 *
 * THE FAMILY: something in the repository ASSERTS a fact about the repository,
 * the fact is false, and nothing fails. No error, no warning, no failing test,
 * no visual difference a reviewer would look for. The assertion is believed
 * precisely because it is written down, and the more carefully it is written
 * the longer it survives.
 *
 * It is not a CSS problem. Every instance below was found in a different
 * mechanism, by a different kind of search, and only one of the five is about
 * stylesheets at all.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SIX INSTANCES FOUND SO FAR, IN THE ORDER THEY TURNED UP.
 *
 * 1. A DECLARATION NAMING A TOKEN THAT DOES NOT EXIST.
 *    `.nf-feedtabs` wrote `var(--nf-surface-glass)` and `var(--nf-blur-sm)`.
 *    Neither name has ever been defined. An unresolved `var()` with no fallback
 *    makes the WHOLE declaration invalid at computed-value time, so the track
 *    painted nothing, under a comment describing the track it painted.
 *    CAUGHT BY A MACHINE: yes, check 4 below.
 *
 * 2. A DECLARATION NAMING A TOKEN OF THE WRONG TYPE.
 *    `.nf-rows-sheet` wrote `background: var(--nf-elev-3)`. That token is a
 *    three-layer box-shadow. The name is real and correctly spelled, so check 4
 *    passed it, and the declaration was still dropped in silence: the settings
 *    sheet had a border, a radius, a shadow, an entrance animation and no fill,
 *    with the page showing through it. Confirmed in a browser afterwards at
 *    `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`.
 *    CAUGHT BY A MACHINE: yes, check 5 below, which exists because of it.
 *
 * 3. A CUSTOM PROPERTY DECLARED TWICE IN ONE RULE, THE LIVE COPY BEING WRONG.
 *    Five `--nf-media-*` tokens appeared twice in the same `:root`, seventeen
 *    lines apart, under a character-for-character copy of the same thirteen-line
 *    comment, with all five values different. The later copy wins, so a retune
 *    that the file's own prose describes ("every part of the building below has
 *    been lifted to match") had never once rendered.
 *    CAUGHT BY A MACHINE: yes, and it is twenty lines. Walk brace depth,
 *    collect `--*` declarations per block, report any name declared twice. Run
 *    once over `tokens.css` and all of `app/css`, it found this and nothing
 *    else. NOT YET A STANDING CHECK. It should be.
 *
 * 4. A COMMENT DESCRIBING A MECHANISM THE CODE NO LONGER HAS.
 *    Three comments stated in the present tense that brand objects carry
 *    `mix-blend-mode: multiply`. The blend mode had been deleted; only the prose
 *    survived. One of them gave ADVICE built on it: "use the approach in
 *    `.nf-page-scene`, which turns multiply off on the night theme".
 *    I reported one of these to my own coordinator as live code, in a report
 *    about this exact fault. Reading a comment and reporting it as behaviour is
 *    the failure mode, and knowing about the family does not protect you.
 *    CAUGHT BY A MACHINE: no, and probably never. A comment is prose. What
 *    helps is a convention: write history in the PAST tense and current
 *    behaviour in the present, so tense alone tells a reader which it is.
 *
 * 5. A CROSS-REFERENCE TO A FILE THAT DOES NOT EXIST.
 *    `.nf-onboarding` was introduced by "see components/site/Onboarding.tsx for
 *    the honest, localStorage-gated, reduced-motion-skipping trigger", and
 *    `.nf-status-assemble` by "see app/agents/status/StatusIcon.tsx for the
 *    honest, one-shot trigger". Neither file exists anywhere under `src`. Both
 *    were eleven and four rules of dead CSS, and both read as obviously live,
 *    because a named component is the strongest evidence a reader gets that a
 *    rule is wired up.
 *    CAUGHT BY A MACHINE: yes, easily, and nothing does it. Extract paths that
 *    look like source files from comments and stat them. Roughly thirty lines.
 *    NOT YET A STANDING CHECK. It should be.
 *
 * 6. TWO BLOCKS IN ONE FILE DESCRIBING THE SAME THING IN CONTRADICTORY TERMS.
 *    `map.css` introduced `.nf-map-pin` with "Price pins on the live map.
 *    Rendered by Leaflet divIcons." Six lines later the next block begins
 *    "Marks are ordinary React buttons projected onto the frame every frame,
 *    NOT Leaflet divIcons". Both were true statements about different eras and
 *    only one was true about the present.
 *    CAUGHT BY A MACHINE: no. This one needs a reader, and it is the argument
 *    for reading a whole file before editing part of it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THE FAMILY TEACHES, WHICH IS THE TRANSFERABLE PART.
 *
 * SILENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE. Every one of the six produced exactly the signal a
 * correct repository produces: nothing. The absence of a failure is only
 * information if something was capable of failing.
 *
 * A GUARD IS AN ASSERTION TOO, SO CHECK ITS OUTPUT AND NOT ITS EXISTENCE. The
 * first draft of check 5 passed the very bug it was written for, because the
 * shadow it was looking for begins `0 2px 4px` and the pattern demanded a unit
 * on the first length. The check was green and the sheet was still transparent.
 * Separately, `withoutComments` deleted comment blocks outright, so every line
 * number this script had ever printed was wrong, by up to 187 lines. Separately
 * again, the raw-colour check reported a COUNT and no location for its whole
 * life. And the first run of check 2 returned nine violations of which two were
 * prose. None of those four would have been found by asking "does the guard
 * fire". All four were found by reading what it printed.
 *
 * THEREFORE: run every new guard against the fault that motivated it, expect
 * the failure, and read the report rather than the exit code.
 *
 * SEARCH ON WORD BOUNDARIES, NOT SUBSTRINGS. A census of unused CSS classes
 * found 54 of 232 with no call site, and three of the dead ones had survived
 * review because a substring search finds a living neighbour: `nf-dock` finds
 * `nf-dock-island`, `nf-action-bar` finds `nf-action-bar-pinned`, `nf-map-pin`
 * finds `nf-map-pin-breathe`. In each case the live thing is a whole class name
 * and not a modifier of the dead one, and in each case a reviewer checking "is
 * this used" would have got a yes.
 *
 * QUIETENING IS NOT REMOVING. Four dead things in this tree had been optimised,
 * slowed, or set to `animation: none` by somebody who had noticed they were
 * unused and fixed the cost instead of the existence. `.nf-hero-scene` was
 * tuned three separate times, each one written up, on a class nothing renders.
 * When a rule keeps coming back for tuning, the cheap question is not "how do I
 * make this cheaper", it is "what renders this".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Layer-1 guard, raw-literal guard and unresolved-token guard for the
 * stylesheets.
 *
 * ESLint cannot see CSS, and the component stylesheets are where half the
 * platform's colour actually lives: `src/app/css/*.css` is nineteen partials
 * and `globals.css` states in its own header that nothing below it may
 * introduce a raw colour. Nothing had ever checked that claim.
 *
 * SIX CHECKS NOW, AND THEY GREW ONE AT A TIME OUT OF THE FAMILY ABOVE.
 *
 *   1  a stylesheet reading a layer-1 palette token       ADR-002
 *   2  a COMPONENT reading one, which nothing could see   ADR-002
 *   3  a raw colour literal in a stylesheet
 *   4  a var() naming a token that does not exist         instance 1
 *   5  a var() naming a token of the wrong type           instance 2
 *   6  does the whole stylesheet still parse              the worst failure
 *
 * 1, 2 and 3 are about where a value came from. 4 and 5 are about whether the
 * value can be used at all. 6 is about whether the product boots. All six are
 * here rather than in ESLint for the reason given in full below: ESLint cannot
 * see CSS.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. A LAYER-1 PALETTE TOKEN read from a stylesheet that is not the token file.
 *
 * FATAL FOR THE WHOLE OF `src/app`, and the `SOFT` predicate that used to
 * exempt the four loose stylesheets is gone with it. They are at zero.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2. A RAW COLOUR LITERAL, `#0C39EF` or `rgb(...)`, in a stylesheet.
 *
 * FATAL FOR THE WHOLE OF `src/app`, in two steps, and this is the second.
 *
 * It used to be counted and not enforced anywhere, and the reasoning was
 * written here at some length: there were several hundred of them, almost all
 * white and black at an alpha, and "a check that fails on a clean checkout is a
 * check somebody deletes rather than obeys". That was correct while the number
 * was several hundred. It became fatal for `src/app/css/**` when those nineteen
 * partials reached zero, and the four loose stylesheets stayed counted because
 * their 74 literals belonged to nobody and failing a build on their behalf is
 * how a check gets deleted rather than obeyed.
 *
 * THOSE 74 ARE NOW ZERO TOO. `social-feed.css` held 64, `social.css` 7 and
 * `settings-rows.css` 3, and the useful thing about doing them was what they
 * turned out to be: the assistant post's card was painted ENTIRELY out of the
 * palette already - `rgb(12 57 239)` is `--nf-electric-400` is the glow ink, so
 * its bloom stops were the glow ladder's rungs written as numbers - and the
 * story viewer needed one extra ink tier and two washes over media, which it
 * had been hand-writing at six and seven different alphas. Four themed pairs
 * were being stated twice each, once in a default rule and once in a
 * `:root[data-theme="light"]` rule, with nothing marking them as twins.
 *
 * So the `SOFT` predicate is deleted rather than narrowed. Every stylesheet
 * under `src/app` is now held to the same line for all three checks.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 3. A `var(--nf-...)` REFERENCING A PROPERTY THAT IS DEFINED NOWHERE, with no
 *    fallback. FATAL for `src/app/css/**`.
 *
 * THIS IS THE CHECK THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT `.nf-feedtabs`, and it is worth
 * setting out what happened, because the failure mode is the point.
 *
 * `chips.css` drew the feed's segmented tab track like this:
 *
 *     background: var(--nf-surface-glass);
 *     backdrop-filter: blur(var(--nf-blur-sm));
 *
 * Neither token exists. There is no `--nf-surface-glass` and no `--nf-blur-sm`
 * in `packages/design-tokens/src/tokens.css`, and there never has been; the
 * fill is `--nf-glass-fill` and the blur ladder is `--nf-glass-blur-thin`,
 * `--nf-glass-blur` and `--nf-glass-blur-strong`. Somebody typed two plausible
 * names.
 *
 * What CSS does with an undefined custom property and no fallback is the whole
 * problem: the `var()` resolves to the guaranteed-invalid value, which makes
 * the ENTIRE DECLARATION invalid at computed-value time, which for `background`
 * means it falls back to the initial value. So the track painted TRANSPARENT
 * and the backdrop filter was dropped outright. Directly above the rule sat a
 * long comment describing "one track, three equal segments, and the live one
 * carries a solid brand pill that moves along the track". There was no track.
 * Three bare labels and a pill.
 *
 * Nothing reported it, and nothing could have. The stylesheet parses. The page
 * renders. No console warning exists for this in any browser, because an
 * unknown custom property is legal CSS - it might be set later by script, by an
 * inline style, or by a class that has not applied yet. The only signal is a
 * control that looks slightly wrong to somebody who already knew what it was
 * supposed to look like. It was found by an audit that was looking for
 * something else entirely.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT CHECK AND NOT AN ESLINT RULE, which is what was
 * originally asked for.
 *
 * Two reasons, and the first is decisive on its own.
 *
 * ESLINT DOES NOT SEE CSS. The bug was in a stylesheet. An `nf/` rule walking
 * string literals in TS and TSX would not have caught this one, nor the next
 * one, because every glass surface, every chrome bar and every elevation rung
 * in this product is declared in `src/app/css/*.css`. Writing the rule where it
 * cannot look at the file the bug was in would be doing the reassuring half of
 * the job, which is the same shape of mistake as a lint rule that was named in
 * three documents and never written.
 *
 * AND RESOLUTION IS WHOLE-TREE, WHICH IS THE WRONG SHAPE FOR A LINTER. Whether
 * `var(--nf-x)` is safe cannot be answered from the file containing it. The
 * property may be defined in `tokens.css`, or declared by an `@property` block
 * in another partial, or written onto an element at runtime by a component -
 * `--nf-sheet-y` comes from `Sheet.tsx`, `--nf-rise-i` from a `home/page.tsx`
 * style prop, `--nf-tab-i` from `MobileTabBar.tsx`. ESLint lints one file at a
 * time and caches per file; a rule that reads the rest of the repository at
 * module load is a rule whose result depends on state it did not declare and
 * which goes stale the moment a token is added. This script already walks the
 * whole tree, so the answer is a set lookup rather than an architecture.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS DEFINED, deliberately generously, because a false positive
 * here fails the build on working code:
 *   - a declaration anywhere in `packages/design-tokens/**\/*.css`
 *   - a declaration in any stylesheet under `src/app`
 *   - an `@property --nf-x` block in any of those
 *   - the name appearing as a quoted string anywhere in `src/**\/*.{ts,tsx}`,
 *     which covers `style={{ "--nf-x": v }}` and `el.style.setProperty("--nf-x")`
 *
 * A `var(--nf-x, something)` with a fallback is never reported, whether or not
 * `--nf-x` resolves. That is the documented way to say "this may not be set",
 * and it is what makes the declaration survive either way.
 *
 * AND IT CHECKS THE TOKEN PACKAGE ITSELF, which is where it matters most.
 *
 * Two surfaces there can go stale in silence and both are checked:
 *
 * `tokens.css` defines tokens IN TERMS OF other tokens -
 * `--nf-glass-shadow: var(--nf-elev-2)`, `--nf-font-display:
 * var(--nf-font-poppins), ...`. A typo in one of those breaks every rule
 * downstream of it and the stylesheet still parses.
 *
 * `index.ts` is a TypeScript MIRROR of the token names, as strings:
 * `contentInverse: "var(--nf-content-inverse)"`. TypeScript cannot check a
 * string against a CSS file, so deleting a token leaves the mirror compiling
 * happily and exporting a `var()` that resolves to nothing. That file's own
 * comments record it having drifted before - eight inks and five mists left
 * holding pre-rebrand purple-tinted greys, so anything drawing an SVG from it
 * painted the old brand - which is precisely this failure with a different
 * cause. This sweep would have caught the deletions the same day.

/*
 * ------------------------------- A GREY EDGE ON A RESTING CONTROL
 *
 * The neutral border family is white at 8, 11, 13 and 22 per cent. On the
 * deep navy canvas every one of those is a grey hairline, and in every
 * governing reference a resting chip, tile, plate, icon button and secondary
 * carries a BLUE outline. R1's audit of 19 September called the gap between
 * those two facts "the biggest single reason the product still does not read
 * as its renders": a screen with one lit primary and eleven grey boxes reads
 * as a prototype with one finished control.
 *
 * The sweep that fixed it is the easy half. This is the half that makes it
 * stay fixed, because the next chip somebody adds will be copied from
 * whatever chip is nearest, and for a long time that was a grey one.
 *
 * FOUR TOKENS, NOT ONE. The first version of this check watched
 * `--nf-glass-border` alone, and `.nf-chip` - the shared primitive behind the
 * bookings tabs, the host wizard's kind chips, the reviews filter and four
 * more surfaces F5 found - rested on `--nf-border-default` and walked
 * straight past it. Two greys with different names is the obvious next
 * mistake, so the whole neutral family is watched.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A CONTROL, and why it is decided from the SELECTOR.
 *
 * There is no way to know from CSS alone whether an element is interactive.
 * What there is, in this codebase, is a naming convention that has held
 * across every partial: a control is named for what it does. `__btn`,
 * `--chip`, `__tab`, `__tile`, `__toggle`, `-island`, `-pill`, `__option`.
 * A rule whose selector carries one of those, or that declares
 * `cursor: pointer`, is a control. Anything else - a divider, a section edge,
 * a scrim, a skeleton, a row of actions - keeps the hairline, because a
 * hairline is exactly right for a line that separates two things.
 *
 * AND ONLY ITS RESTING RULE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE PRECISION OF THIS CHECK.
 *
 * The first version treated `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus` and
 * `[aria-pressed]` as EVIDENCE that a rule was a control, which is true and
 * is the wrong way round: the fault the founder photographed is a resting
 * control that looks unfinished, and a state rule is not the resting state.
 * A hover that darkens toward a neutral, a focus ring that sets a border, a
 * disabled button that goes grey on purpose and a light-theme override that
 * is a designed paper twin are all legitimate, and flagging thirty of them
 * is how a check gets switched off in a week - which this file's own header
 * warns about at length.
 *
 * So a state selector and a `[data-theme="light"]` selector are EXCLUDED, and
 * what is left is exactly the fault: the edge a control wears when nothing
 * is happening to it, in the theme that is the product's default.
 *
 * THE PARSE IS DELIBERATELY CRUDE, on the same argument `SOLE_VAR` above
 * makes for itself: brace depth and the text before `{`. It cannot see a rule
 * written inline. An over-eager report names a file and a line that a reader
 * can look at and dismiss, which is the right way round for a check to be
 * wrong.

 *   `.nf-switch`, in both files that draw one, is a TRACK in its off

 *   blue track would say the switch is on before anybody touched it.
 *
 *   `.nf-option` belongs to the agent workspace and selects with
 *   `--nf-mode-agent`. Its own comment argues it is an inset ANSWER inside a
 *   container rather than an object, and the mode's whole point is that it is
 *   not the brand. A brand-blue resting edge would put brand chrome inside a
 *   surface deliberately built not to wear it.

 * are listed so the gate stays green for their owner today and so the rule is

 * delete it when the edge is swept, and never add one to make a build pass.
 *
 *   `catalogue.css` (F3): the shelf sort control and two card chips. The

/*
 * ------------------------------- CHECK TEN: A CAPSULE ON A CONTROL
 *
 * THE LAW IT ENFORCES, which is a founder ruling of 19 September and is
 * written up in `docs/DESIGN_DIRECTION.md` section 1.
 *
 * Any control that carries TEXT is a ROUNDED RECTANGLE on
 * `--nf-radius-control`. Every button, chip, segment, tab, filter chip,
 * input, dock label, sheet action and admin control. Two exceptions and no
 * others: an avatar, and a bare icon button carrying no text that a governing
 * image draws round, which today is the landing nav's search glyph and
 * nothing else. `GOVERNING-landing-desktop-hero.png` has no capsule anywhere
 * in it and one circle, that glyph; `GOVERNING-chat-booking-card.png` draws
 * send, back, call and overflow as rounded squares and keeps the circle for
 * avatars.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A CHECK AND NOT A SWEEP. The capsule was never a decision
 * anybody took per control. `tokens.css` records it: `--nf-radius-pill` was
 * for a long time the only token name that meant "a control", so every button
 * and chip became a 999px capsule by having nowhere else to point. A sweep
 * fixes today's call sites. It does not fix the next chip, which will be
 * copied from whatever chip is nearest, and this rule exists so that the
 * nearest chip can never again be a capsule.
 *
 * IT DECIDES "CONTROL" EXACTLY AS CHECK NINE DOES, through the same
 * `restingControlFaults` walk: the same `CONTROL_SELECTOR` vocabulary, the
 * same `cursor: pointer` fallback, the same `NOT_RESTING` exclusion of state
 * and paper-twin selectors. A second vocabulary for the same question is how
 * two checks come to disagree about what a control is, and check nine already
 * learned that lesson once when it watched a single border token and `.nf-chip`
 * rested on a different one.
 *
 * WHAT A PILL RADIUS IS, for this check: `var(--nf-radius-pill)`,
 * `var(--nf-radius-control-pill)`, and a literal `999px` or `9999px`.
 *
 * `50%` AND `--nf-radius-circle` ARE NOT REPORTED, deliberately. That is how
 * an avatar, a status dot and a count badge are drawn and they are correct as
 * circles; the ruling's own words are that a dot, a spinner, a progress ring,
 * an avatar ring and a story ring are not controls. A circle token on a rule
 * whose selector carries a control word is the one hole left open here, and it
 * is open because closing it would fire on every avatar in the tree.
 *
 * AND IT RUNS OVER TSX TOO, which is new for a shape rule and is where the
 * sweep that motivated it did most of its work. There the question "is this a
 * control" has a better answer than a selector: the radius is written in the
 * opening tag of an element, and the element has a NAME. A `rounded-full` in
 * the opening tag of a `button`, `a`, `Link`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`,
 * `summary`, `Button`, `ButtonLink` or `Chip` is a capsule on a control. The
 * same class on a `span` or a `div` is not reported, because that is an
 * avatar, a dot, a bar, a ring or a skeleton nine times in ten and this check
 * would be switched off inside a week if it said otherwise.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS RULE CANNOT SEE, AND IT IS MORE THAN THE OTHERS CANNOT SEE.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT GREPS SOURCE TEXT. IT CANNOT PROVE WHAT THE BROWSER RESOLVED.
 * That sentence belongs at the top of this file rather than in one check, and
 * it is here because it was paid for today: a single unlayered
 * `* { border-color: ... }` in `base.css` was outranking every layered brand
 * edge in the product, and every check in this file passed the whole time,
 * correctly, because the source text each of them reads was right. Cascade,
 * layer order, specificity and inheritance are all invisible here. A green run
 * of this file means the text is right. It does not mean the screen is.
 *
 * So, specifically, this check does not see:
 *
 *   A RADIUS THAT ARRIVES FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. `<button className="nf-chip">`
 *   is reported only if `.nf-chip` itself is caught in the stylesheet pass.
 *   A capsule reaching a control through a shared class, a cascade, an inline
 *   style computed at runtime, or a `style` prop holding a variable, is
 *   outside it.
 *
 *   WHETHER THE CONTROL CARRIES TEXT. The ruling's line is drawn at text and
 *   this check is drawn at controls, which is the wider set. An icon-only
 *   button written as a circle is reported. That is deliberate: the two
 *   exceptions the ruling allows are an avatar and one nav glyph, both of
 *   which are drawn in CSS on rules that name them, so a TSX control asking
 *   for a capsule is a fault every time so far. If a genuine round icon
 *   control ever needs to live in TSX, it goes in `PILL_ALLOWED_TSX` below
 *   with its reason, and the reason has to name the governing image.
 *
 *   A RULE WRITTEN INLINE, on one line with its selector, or a selector split
 *   across lines. Same crude brace walk as check nine, same argument for it.
 *
 *   A `shape="pill"` PROP. `Button`, `Chip` and `StatusPill` each still carry
 *   one, and it maps to a class rather than to a radius, so nothing here can
 *   read it. All three are marked `@deprecated` and no surface outside
 *   `app/(dev)/preview/g1/` passes one; what closes that door properly is this
 *   check firing on `nf-btn--pill` and `nf-chip--pill` in the stylesheets, and
 *   their owners deleting the rules.

/*
 * LAYER 1 READ FROM A COMPONENT, which no guard in this repository could see
 * until today.
 *
 * The check above has always run over stylesheets only. `nf/no-raw-colour`
 * catches a literal in a component and has nothing to say about a token name.
 * So ADR-002 was enforced in CSS and unenforced in TSX, which is where most of
 * the product's colour decisions are actually written, and seven components had
 * been reading the raw ramps directly for long enough that one of them carries a
 * comment saying so: `app/agent/list/ListingWizard.tsx` notes that reading
 * `--nf-electric-300` "is the one thing ADR-002 forbids". Somebody knew, wrote
 * it down beside the code, and nothing turned that into a failing check.
 *
 * It was found as a side effect of proposing a rename, not by looking. That is
 * the argument for the check rather than for fixing the seven: a rule enforced
 * on one file type and not the other is not a rule, it is a habit that holds
 * wherever somebody happens to be looking.
 *
 * ONLY `var(--nf-x)` COUNTS, not the bare name. This codebase explains itself by
 * quoting the token it replaced, so a name inside a backtick is evidence of an
 * argument rather than of a reference, and a check that punished that would be
 * switched off within a week. The same reasoning is why the three `nf/` lint
 * rules walk the AST instead of the source.
 *
 * AND COMMENTS HAD TO BE STRIPPED, WHICH THE FIRST RUN OF THIS CHECK PROVED
 * RATHER THAN THE FIRST DRAFT PREDICTING IT. The paragraph above was written
 * before the check ran and it says a name in a comment is not a reference. It
 * was not enough: this file's comments quote the FULL `var(--nf-cyan-400)` form
 * while explaining a token chain, because that is how you write down what a
 * token resolves to. Nine violations came back and two were prose, in
 * `admin/_components/ui.tsx` and `components/app/ResultSheet.tsx`, both of them
 * notes arguing that `--nf-state-warning` and `--nf-status-pending` are the same
 * value under two names.
 *
 * 22 per cent noise on the first run of a check whose whole purpose is to be
 * believed. It was caught by reading what the check PRINTED rather than
 * confirming that it printed something, which is the one habit this file is
 * worth reading for.
 *
 * The stripping is deliberately conservative: block comments, and lines whose
 * first non-space character is `//` or `*`. It will not catch a `var()` in a
 * trailing comment after code on the same line. That is rare, and the failure
 * mode is a visible false positive that the reader can see is prose, which is
 * the right way round for a check to be wrong.
 */
/*
 * AND `accept="image/*"` USED TO SWALLOW NINE HUNDRED LINES OF A COMPONENT.
 *
 * The first version opened a block comment at any `/*`. `ListingWizard.tsx`
 * writes `accept="image/*"` on its file input, so the stripper opened a
 * comment inside a string literal and closed it at the next real `*\/`, which
 * was 900 lines later. Everything between was blanked, so check 2 could not
 * have reported a layer-1 token anywhere in it, and nothing said so: the
 * check ran, printed nothing, and the silence read as a pass. That is this
 * file's own fault family, in this file's own helper, and it was found by
 * check 10 printing a `<input>` for a `<span>` and the report being read
 * rather than counted.
 *
 * A comment opener is now one that FOLLOWS nothing, whitespace, or an opening
 * bracket, comma, semicolon, colon or `=`. A `/*` that follows a word
 * character, which is what a glob in a MIME type or a URL looks like, is not
 * a comment. The captured character is put back so offsets do not move.

 *
 * `@import "tailwindcss"` and the token package are resolved by the bundler and

 * queue writes.
 *
 * IT DEGRADES TO A SKIP. `lightningcss` is here because Next depends on it, not

 * CHECK EIGHT REPORTS AND DOES NOT FAIL, AND THAT IS A JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHAT A

 *
 * Every other check here is decidable. A `var()` either names a defined token or
 * it does not; a property either takes a shadow or it does not. A path in prose
 * is not, because whether it is a FAULT depends entirely on the tense of the
 * sentence around it, and prose has no syntax for tense that a regular
 * expression can read. The first run of this check found four kinds and only two
 * of them are wrong:
 *
 *   VOUCHING    "see components/site/Onboarding.tsx for the honest trigger"
 *               Asserts the file exists now. It never has. FAULT, and this is
 *               the one the check was built for: it vouched for eleven rules of
 *               dead CSS and read as obviously live.
 *
 *   STALE       "lib/agent/repository.ts had already decided the principle"
 *               Asserts the file exists now. It does not. FAULT, or the path is
 *               mistyped, and either way somebody will go looking.
 *
 *   HISTORICAL  "everything below arrived from components/app/assistant/glyphs.tsx"
 *               Correct. The file is gone BECAUSE of the change being described.
 *
 *   FORWARD     "delete this the day AgentShell moves into app/agent/layout.tsx"
 *               Correct. The file does not exist yet and that is the point.
 *
 * So it prints its list and exits zero, because a check that fails on correct
 * prose is one somebody deletes rather than obeys, and that rule is older than
 * this check.
 *
 * IT IS FATAL NOW, AND THE CONDITION BELOW IS WHY. The two correct kinds only
 * need an extensioned path because we habitually write one. Name the DIRECTORY,
 * or drop the extension, when you are recalling a file or predicting one:
 * "arrived from `components/app/assistant/`" says the same thing and cannot be
 * mistaken for a live reference by a reader either. Write a full path with an
 * extension only when you are asserting that the file is there to be opened.
 * THE CONDITION WAS "once the tree is clean under that convention", and it was
 * met three references later: the design system's own files were converted the
 * day the check was written, and the last three, two stale and one forward, were
 * cleared by their owner in the block after. So this fails now. A check held at
 * report-only past the point where it is clean is a check nobody will ever
 * promote, because there is never a better moment than the one where the count
 * is zero.
 *
 * The convention it enforces is written up in
 * `packages/design-tokens/README.md` under "Writing about a file in a comment",
 * with the table of four kinds. If this fires on a comment that is recalling or
 * predicting a file, the fix is to name the directory or drop the extension,
 * not to add the path to an exception list.
