    // DELEGATE, not on the plugin. If they are absent, the token is delivered
    // to nobody, the plugin's `registration` listener never fires, and the
    // JavaScript side waits for an event that cannot arrive. Nothing errors.
    // It is the exact shape of failure this whole feature was written to
    // refuse, and it is a missing method rather than a missing line of logic.

    // observes these names and does the rest. Posting the notification is all
    // that is required here, and doing more would duplicate the plugin.

// MARK: - Notification centre delegate: owned by Capacitor, not by this class
//
// This file used to extend AppDelegate as a `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`
// to show banners in the foreground and forward taps. Removed on 28 September
// 2026 (native release audit), for two reasons, either of which was enough:
//
// 1. IT DID NOT COMPILE. The tap method posted
//    `Notification.Name.capacitorDidReceiveNotificationResponse`, a name that
//    does not exist in Capacitor 8.5 (`CAPNotifications.swift` defines the
//    full list). No Xcode build had ever run, so nothing caught it.
// 2. IT WOULD NEVER HAVE RUN. `CapacitorBridge` sets its `NotificationRouter`
//    as the centre's delegate when the web view loads, after launch, so the
//    router wins. The router gives `willPresent` to the push plugin, which
//    reads `plugins.PushNotifications.presentationOptions` from
//    `capacitor.config.ts` (badge, sound, alert), and gives the tap to the
//    plugin, which raises `pushNotificationActionPerformed` for
//    `src/lib/native/push-taps.ts`. Foreground banners and tap routing are
//    therefore both handled without any code here.
