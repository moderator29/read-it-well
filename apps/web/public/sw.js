/*
 * Vallo service worker. Hand written, no library, deliberately small.
 *
 * The audience is Nigerian and frequently on a mid-range Android over 3G with
 * a metered data bundle, so this worker has four jobs and no others:
 *
 *   1. OPEN WHAT YOU ALREADY SAW, WITH OR WITHOUT SIGNAL (the founder, 8
 *      October 2026: an app that shows a full-screen "no connection" card
 *      instead of the screen you were just on is not how Instagram, WhatsApp
 *      or Airbnb behave). Every page a member opens is kept on this phone,
 *      for that member only, and answers again when the network is down or
 *      too slow to wait for. See THE PAGES below.
 *   2. Keep a tiny offline shell so a page that was never opened here, asked
 *      for with no network, shows one calm Vallo screen instead of the
 *      browser's dinosaur.
 *   3. Stop the phone paying twice for bytes that never change (the hashed
 *      Next build output, the brand artwork, the fonts and the listing
 *      photographs the optimiser has already sized for this phone).
 *   4. Turn a push into a notification, and a tap on that notification into
 *      the right screen. See THE PUSH HALF at the foot of this file.
 *
 * THE PUSH HANDLERS LIVE HERE AND NOT IN A SECOND WORKER, and that is a
 * correctness decision rather than a tidiness one. TWO REGISTRATIONS AT THE
 * SAME SCOPE ARE NOT TWO WORKERS, THEY ARE ONE WORKER REPLACING THE OTHER, so
 * a push worker registered at `/` would have silently uninstalled the offline
 * shell above. The previous arrangement dodged that by serving a second
 * worker from `/api/push/sw` at the narrower scope `/api/push/`, where it
 * could not displace anything. It cost one thing and the cost was the whole
 * point of a notification: `clients.matchAll()` only returns pages inside the
 * scope, so a tap could not see an already-open Vallo tab and opened a second
 * one. One worker at `/` sees every tab, so a tap lands in the tab the person
 * already has.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO:
 *
 *   - Answer one person with another person's page. Pages are kept per
 *     VIEWER, and the viewer is not something a page claims: the server
 *     stamps every document it renders with `x-vallo-viewer` (`proxy.ts`), an
 *     opaque digest of the signed-in account, or `anon`, on the response and
 *     again in the head (`app/layout.tsx`, the copy the Android app can read;
 *     `lib/offline/viewer-stamp.ts` says why). A page is kept only
 *     under the viewer its own response names, the moment a response names a
 *     different viewer every page kept for the previous one is deleted, and
 *     signing out deletes them all from the page as well
 *     (`lib/offline/page-cache.ts`). A response with no stamp (an auth outage,
 *     a redirect, a refreshed session cookie) is never kept.
 *   - Keep money, identity or a live call. The never-kept list below covers
 *     the API, every route that moves or shows money (wallet, checkout, pay,
 *     payments, payouts, refunds, receipts, rent), sign-in and its kin,
 *     security settings, admin and the supply workspaces. A stale balance is
 *     worse than none, so those routes go to the network or to the offline
 *     screen, never to an old copy.
 *   - Write anything that is not a plain same-origin GET. Server actions,
 *     every POST, every webhook and every API response go straight out,
 *     untouched.
 *   - Answer an asset from a response that says it is personal: anything
 *     carrying Authorization, Set-Cookie, Vary: Cookie, or a no-store /
 *     private directive is passed through untouched.
 *
 * Save-Data is respected: when the hint is present the background refresh of
 * the asset cache and the warming of visited pages are skipped, because
 * fetching a second copy is itself paid-for traffic the person has asked us
 * to economise on. A response that was already fetched is still kept, which
 * costs nothing.
 *
 * Bump CACHE_VERSION on any change to this file. The activate step deletes
 * every cache that is not in the current set, so a deploy can never leave a
 * person on last week's shell.

 * this object and nothing else:
 *
 *     { title, body, href, tag, urgent }
 *
 * Every field is re-checked here. The sender already refuses an off-origin
 * href; this refuses it again, because a notification is a place a tap leaves
 * the application from and it is not a place to take a sender's word for a
 * destination. A push service cannot read the ciphertext, but a compromised
 * application server could, and the second check costs four lines.
