   * BECOME AN AGENT IS NOT A DESTINATION ANY MORE.

   * `/agents/status` screen: a separate marketing funnel, in the public site
   * chrome, for something that is not a separate product. It is one account
   * with three profiles on it. You switch to the Seller or the Realtor profile
   * from the switch-profile sheet, and if that profile is not set up the sheet
   * explains what it is and starts the setup. So the three routes are gone and
   * these three redirects put anything still pointing at them where the thing
   * actually lives now.
   *
   * WHY REDIRECTS RATHER THAN JUST DELETING THEM. Three groups of links are
   * outside this change's reach: the marketing pages under `(site)`, which
   * another owner holds; the help centre and the docs chapters, which quote
   * the address in prose; and anything a person has already shared. A 404 on
   * "become an agent" is the worst possible answer for somebody who wants to
   * list a property, and it is the one visitor the business most wants.
   *
   * `/agents` lands on the profile with `?switch=owner`, which opens the
   * switch-profile sheet on the Seller explanation. That is the replacement,
   * exactly: the pitch is now the thing that starts the setup.

   * forever and these addresses may yet be wanted for something else.
